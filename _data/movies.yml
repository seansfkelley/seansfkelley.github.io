  watch-this: because it's important to anime history, and because it's beautifully animated, if a bit narratively haphazard.
  more-thoughts: |
    The animation here is -- to use a tired term -- very lush. It's a full 24fps (instead of the usual 12fps), and they frequently bother to animate things in the background or elements of the scene that you could ignore if they left them static, such as the sheets on a bed.

    The plot lurches around a bit, bringing up questions, starting new threads or introducing new characters with an absolute minimum of exposition. For instance, they showed the underlying justification for Tetsuo's violence -- his rensentment towards Kaneda always rescuing him -- but there's a few steps between that and mass murder. This is because the movie is highly condensed from the source manga.

    [This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqVoEpRIaKgv) does a good job explaining the significance of the movie and the influences on its production.

  more-thoughts: |
    This movie was also a similar shape to Seven Samurai and Ocean's Eleven... in fact, I'd say the former is the archetype for the category containing all of these. I appreciated that the movie was largely a transposition of Kurosawa-era samurai movies into the modern era, from the forceful, almost stilted play-like dialogue to the more-realistic, less flashy sword choreography. Several things broke that illusion: explosives generally, flaming CGI cows (?!), and most especially the huge wave of blood that overtopped a building.

    One of the duels looked all the world like it re-borrowed the choreography of a classic lightsaber duel. (If there was any doubt that Star Wars is a samurai movie.)

  more-thoughts: |
    On top of the _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_ similarity, there's a strong element of almost-Charlie-Chaplin-style physical comedy contributed by Roberto Benigni. He steals the scene in every scene he's in, so much so that Tom Waits and John Lurie came off to me more like foils for him than standalone characters. The movie has a _very_ slow start on top of the already generally slow pacing... it would have benefitted from a 10-ish minute shortening but other than that it's an endearing character piece.

  more-thoughts: |
    I really liked seeing samurai culture projected onto the Vikings, as well as the sparing use of anime visual tropes where they would have the greatest effect (usually, comedic). The main character was really Askeladd, not Thorfinn, and he was a noticeably deeper character than anyone else in the show. Thorfinn and crowd-favorite Thorkell were ultimately pretty flat. Some pivotal scenes had too little dialogue (e.g. Askeladd "convincing" the king not to attack Wales, which awed the attending crowd even though it was about 3 sentences), but all animes do have a tell-not-show habit.

    Most people were real ([Sweyn Forkbeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweyn_Forkbeard), whose father was [Harald Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Bluetooth), yes, that Bluetooth; [Cnut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut), though I can't find any reason why they rendered him so effeminate; [Thorkell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorkell_the_Tall); and sort-of [Askeladd[en]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Askeladden)), the [Vinland sagas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland_sagas) do exist, and the major events more or less happened that way (or in the case of Sweyn's assassination, we don't know but it's possible).

  watch-this: for a Terry-Gilliam-esque film noir take on the Matrix (but watch the director's cut).
  more-thoughts: |
    What makes this a Terry-Gilliam-esque movie is the zany ideas with correspondingly zany sets and costumes, but they're only loosely connected to the core parts of the plot and the plot itself is more told than shown. The practical effects have lots of bits and bobs so you can tell the designers had a fun time, but it also means they overshoot their narrative purpose by drawing too much attention.

    There was no character development, which was a shame. The editing was _really_ fast, which was immediately noticeable and took a long time to get used to. The movie had absolutely no breaks, and would have benefitted from being 10% longer so that you could linger and process some of the scenes before the next one arrived. The exposition was just barely enough to follow.

    If nothing else, it makes you appreciate just how much the Matrix was a movie from the future. This movie was very of its era. Even though they jumbled up different eras in the city design -- and explained it as being on purpose, which was cute.

    I wanted the movie to either commit to the goofiness of the premise (like Groundhog Day, or the Truman Show) or use it to explore a supernatural idea (Black Mirror lite). It chose the middle road, and so is kind of a middling movie. Example: the romance was not at all believable. I expected it to be explained as "because the author said so" and go from there but the movie seemed to want it to stand on its own merits, which it did not. Also, it seemed confused if it was a weird rom-com or not. The movie was 105-ish minutes long; they had time to justify the relationship better than they did, but the whole movie dragged a bit.

Is Antigone's dad at all relevant to anything? What's CHP-boy's name, even?

    I ended up reading the synopsis on Wikipedia, which was a good call. Suffice to say that almost everyone ends up dead, those that don't end up in Venezuela (lol), and there were a few surprise children in there for good measure. Also stolen diamonds, the Rodney King riots, Mexican cartels, ecstasy, arson, blackmail, shootouts, shootouts at meth labs...

    This movie was difficult to follow and changed course a few times in ways that didn't seem necessary. It started pretty grounded and small scale, but every chase and fight was more ridiculous than the last, complete with car exploding into fireball. The hyperviolence didn't have any of the visual charm and/or narrative value that you'd find in e.g. Oldboy or a Tarantino movie, and only served to further confuse who was killing who and for what reason. The soundtrack often felt out of place. And why were the cops so often bumbling, almost cartoonish idiots?

    The initial assassination plotline was so long that when it ended I thought the movie had flown by. But no, there was another 90 minutes or incoherent slaughter and predictable chase scenarios. I still don't understand why the gang leader wanted to kill his own disposable, amateur assassin.

    A great idea, flattened, corporatized and overproduced into flashly blandness. I think the point was to adapt Poe stories, one per episode like an old-school storytelling serial, but framed in an overarching Poe story, and with heavy foreshadowing so that you're there to watch it unravel (rather than waiting for the twist). I like, except...

    The one-dimensional characters are immediately slotted into their designated roles, and in most cases have been focus-group tested to ensure they've got a token everybody. This guy's children span generations, the globe (accents included) and the sexual spectrum, all of which is just frankly unbelievable for a Sackler. Which he is, and they point it out many, many, many, many, many times in case you didn't get it.

    Speaking of sex, the amount of utterly pointless nudity and implied (or near) sex they show is frankly tedious. Sex can advance a story, but here it never does -- it's just softcore porn. Also trashy is the product placement, which will ensure the story ages badly (Tesla, Starbucks, Facebook, TikTok, and likely others).

    This show forgot the most important part about stories carried by powerful yet contemptible people: character development, conflictedness and/or opponents. Indeed, all of these rich people are _fucking awful_, but the story can't even muster a joker son as comic relief -- a low storytelling bar. Even serial killer movies don't have characters this unrelentingly unlikeable.

    Lastly, and most offensively, they tore out the parts of the original stories that make them compelling. It's really important in _The Masque of the Red Death_ that there is a plague, that the nobles have been holed up in their Versailles for a long time and that the mysterious figure can't be misinterpreted as a hallucination (which I very much did). They dropped all that, so there was maybe 5 minutes of straight-line plot in the hour-long episode. But there sure was a lot of fucking, even by people in the side story lines.

Dina playing coach and Tommy following (not leading) Ellie to Seattle emphasize her as the main character but rob them and other characters of depth, and Ellie's writing just doesn't feel like it supports her assigned narrative role.

    Telling everybody what was up with Abby from the beginning of the season was a weird choice. Isn't the big reveal about her vendetta supposed to turn all your previous perception on its head?

    We want to learn more about the Seraphites and WLF but the weirdly-short season doesn't permit that. And what was with her landing on the island for like 15 seconds in the finale?

Despite the runtime, it did a bunch of telling and not much showing.

    Issa Rae's fish-out-of-water persona was too in-your-face, which was both the fault of the writing (e.g., the usage of "shit") and her 2020s delivery. I liked it better when Black Mirror used unknown actors for all roles.

Truly, overwhelmingly, banal. Some worldbuilding would have been preferred to the filler... though the weapons were so weird as to be kinda dumb instead of cool.

    Nobody could have swung this like Christian Bale did. He was a little _too_ robotic in a handful of scenes, but the range he demonstrated even within individual scenes (like Paul Allen's murder) is impressive and probably _the_ reason the movie sticks the landing.

I think he killed Paul Allen, but nobody can tell anyone apart and nobody actually cared about him, so the investigation kind of fizzles out. The killing spree was definitely hallucinated.

    I would have liked a little more worldbuilding, but that didn't stop me from watching 10 episodes in two days! The neo-noir thriller elements blended reasonably well into spacefaring mystery-adventure and the heavy-handed social commentary parts, the latter of which thankfully didn't overbear into preachiness.

    <summary>👍 Seasons 2-3</summary>
    I lumped these together because I'm writing this review late and I can't remember where the line is between these seasons, as they're very same-y.

    The diverging genres and intersecting plotlines of the first season are gone, replaced by a more traditional sci-fi arc. It's still mostly good, but the protomolecule is straight-up shameless [phlebotinum](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum), which makes it difficult to really emotionally invest in said arc and gets narratively tiresome. The characters don't develop much, and some of the ones I like best, like Anderson Dawes, just fade away.

    Yikes. I was glad for the sharp change in plot direction, because the Halo-esque planet-sized-machine-to-kill-whatever-killed-this-advanced-alien-race-but-failed is near and dear to my heart, but the writing got bad.

    The season is mostly tensionless filler.

    The election arc? Predictable and empty. Bobby's criminal arc? Okay, but too drawn-out and riddled with plot holes (there's no reason she would risk her life for one of these missions!). Medina Station? Fun interpersonal dynamics, but _nothing is happening_.

    But the worst is the Ilus arc. An exploding island (which I think is okay in this universe!) would not cause a planet-spanning shockwave and tsunami that will travel hundreds of miles overland. This impossible tsunami motivates a useless and circuitous subplot that, after several episodes, finds all the characters more or less where they already were, minus a camp, but still stuck with the cartoon villain heading up RCE. The blindness virus lost all narrative credibility when Amos got it, because there was no way the writers would let him stay blind, and lo: a miracle cure. Speaking of Amos, he's become monosyllabic comic relief, which was always a risk though they used to give him glimpses of deeper personality. This arc should have picked one major problem and dug into it instead of throwing shit at the wall to see what stuck.

    <summary>👎 Season 5</summary>
    The show is creaking under its own weight. Things have to keep getting larger, otherwise, Amazon thinks it won't be able to keep your attention.

    Marco Inaros has character potential, but like the guy from the previous season, ends up a cartoon villain. There are some interesting bits of sci-fi, like flinging steath-shielded asteroids as a weapon, or Naomi doing an emergency suitless EVA. We learn that the Rocinante crew is much more engaging together than they are apart, even though their interactions while together are getting a little stale. I quickly learn to dread scenes with Filip and either of his parents.

    And no, [Marco is not wearing eyeliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keon_Alexander), he just looks like that!

    <details markdown="1">
    <summary>👎 Season 6</summary>
    In the _final season_, several new plotlines are opened and are intentionally not pursued. I read this as an attempt to avoid the common problem of a wide-ranging show always somehow ending up artificially neatly tied up with a bow, but instead it feels like they just forgot about the subplots.

    The hardness of the sci-fi begins to soften (resurrection, really?), which is disappointing. A lot happens in the final episode, but it still somehow feels like it drags, and all the plotlines that aren't forgotten about do end up with a neat bow anyway. Nobody undeserving gets hurt (Filip escaped, really?), because the focus groups wouldn't like that. Marco dies with a whimper more or less out of nowhere, because the all-too-predictable requirements of the narrative arc require that Naomi be the one to kill him in a uniquely Naomi way (the "entities", really?).

    The best part of this season was the surprising efficacy with which they handled [Cas Anvar being a creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas_Anvar#Sexual_misconduct_allegations), namely, by having the characters reminisce about the _character_ Alex without ever showing the actor again.

    A much more violent plot than I remember from watching it the first time. Much funnier if you've see The Wicker Man, even though there are few direct references to it.

    Robert Downey Jr.'s typical frenetic style defines this movie, in fact, this might be one of the more representative examples of his style. This means that, as narrator, his style defines the feel of the movie, which can get a little tiresome when coupled with the fourth-wall breaking narration. It's kinda fun but not particularly clever, and a few times I wanted him to cut it out.

    The chemistry between the three main characters is excellent and carries the movie, though the Robert Downey Jr./Val Kilmer interactions are for sure the most entertaining dynamic in the movie.

    This movie was _okay_. The ensemble-cast-running-around-a-big-house-with-comedic-relief thing has been done better in other movies, and the horror elements are light and very trope-y. Dark-comedy-action-fluff.

    Alex's change of heart was poorly motivated. It seemed like Grace saying she wouldn't be with him after, y'know, everything, was enough to flip him completely 180. The only hint that might happen was the private conversation with his mother, but he had no reason to lie to her then (and what, be deep undercover?) so the twist must have been unplanned, as it was presented.

  more-thoughts: |
    What was the point of this movie? The main narrative arc -- man's negligence leads to death, gets cursed, eventually yields to curse, curse is lifted -- is unrewarding and seems incomplete. The possible explanations (fate? prophecy? witchcraft? gods? [heat ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System)?) are so broad that the movie's high-brow refusal to acknowledge any one of them is simply obnoxious, and the whole thing ends on a whimper of unexplored consequences.

    The stilted dialogue got old fast since it didn't seem to serve a worldbuilding purpose a la [The Lobster](#the-lobster-2015) and everything otherwise seemed normal. The soundtrack was so overbearing that at certain scenes I was distracted from the story, instead just hoping the music would stop. I suppose the goal was to maximize eerieness, but these superficial approaches clashed more than cohered, and the lack of compelling narrative left them to carry the weight of the movie alone.

    The acting was great though, on its own terms.

    I liked the groundedness of this version of the story (unlike the "most canonical" origin story that involves falling into a vat of chemicals), and will note that the movie both echoes *V for Vendetta* and more or less foretells the reaction to the shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. I read it as a symbol of the times, since the movie is only a few years old: when a murderous psychopath comes off as sympathetic, things are bad.

    One detail I loved: the detective is reciting his phone number on the answering machine while Joker is  crashing around pulling things out of the fridge, so you can't hear the part where he would have said "555". [555 numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_(telephone_number)) can (and do) spoil immersion.

    Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, but I kept getting distracted because he looked kind of like a blend of [Bill Hader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hader) and [Noel Fielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Fielding).

    I love the idea behind this fan edit, and think it's (accidentally?) a really excellent comparative analysis that highlights the flaws in the source material.

    I went in expecting it to have a more Kurosawa-ish feel, but episodes I-III are written and edited way too fast to ever let you breathe, and the fan edits on top are also really aggressive to keep the runtime in check. The source material is also exceptionally visually cluttered; some scenes really suffer from the lack of color and contrast to help parse them. This is a failure of the originals, not the edit. Coruscant, for instance, is an undifferentiated mass of grey.

    Supposedly the dubbing doesn't line up with the original dialog, which is a perfect escape hatch to allow skipping over storytelling inanities like midichlorians. But there's still attention to detail: easily-recognized Japanese words like "hai" or "okasa" appear in the right places, so it still feels right if you're used to hearing anime.

Mark Rylance absolutely carries the whole movie, even though it's descibed as an ensemble cast. I did think that Francis more or less rising from the dead at the end was pointless. Did we need to be told so bluntly that Leonard was who he said he was?

    Very. Strong. The Last of Us. Energy. I like a zombie movie that takes itself seriously.

    This movie had some seriously fresh takes on the genre, as well as some unique scenes. Second-generation zombies as symbiotes adds a whole dimension of competing motivations. I have only ever seen a scene walking through a crowd of zombies in Shaun of the Dead -- this is hard to make believable! Melanie was very clever and well-acted.

    The ending was pretty cheesy, though I appreciated the role reversal of lessons-in-a-tiny-box from the beginning of the movie. Still, I would rather have her just released the spores for everyone and been done with it. I also didn't particularly like the feral children, and they only really became "necessary" to fill out the class at the end.

Still, I like that there was a little flourish at the end with the reveal that the whole thing was about stunt men: admittedly I was too distracted to figure that out ahead of time, and it elevated the whole plot.

    I _loved_ the way this movie worked the girl's questions into the story. Watching the characters react as Lee Pace adjusts the narrative on the fly was fun and novel, and the transition between his narration and letting the characters speak was very smooth so the interruptions weren't jarring.

    The premise was neat and the cinematography was _excellent_, but it was largely repetitive, the softcore porn and gore were both way beyond what was necessary to demonstrate the point and the social commentary was so simplistic and heavyhanded that it was like bad satire.

    The long-delayed ending highlighted the flaws: a strong hint at a twist that was immediately rescinded (why were they applauding the monster walking down the hallway?), wildly incongruous 70s-style gore, and a general violation of the established rules of the universe. It would have played _much_ better if they'd cut to black as she was injecting the activator for the second time, then let you speculate.

    All that said, I loved a lot of the shots (in particular the early one at the urinal) and thought it was clever how they made an ASMR horror movie (so you can't just shut your eyes!) with very, very little dialogue.

    This was like a Black Mirror episode, but without any cleverness or depth to the commentary. Or like The Office, but not really funny. In short: stressful but without a reward. The whole thing ends with a whimper.

    I didn't appreciate the in-your-face Gen Z social media commentary near the end: yeah, we get that the reference was internet lynch mobs. It served no narrative or explanatory purpose and was just a triggering cheap shot out of left field.

    For an episode that repeats several times how beautiful Scotland is, they really ruined some shots with that gigantic branded rental van sitting there like a billboard.

    This movie was surprisingly apolitical, in the sense that it didn't choose a side (left/right) and stuck to merely anti-establishment.

    For the first two thirds of the movie I kept thinking about The Last of Us, which is telling because I think post-apocalyptic movies are only way we see the US looking anything like this. It's an effective translation of what it means to be war-torn for a country that hasn't taken it for 150 years, but loves to dish it out.

    The tense moments were sometimes undermined by the poor decision-making that led there (i.e. any time a journalist died). Why didn't they bring a medical kit in that huge car if they were heading into a warzone?

It gave me a movie with a Russian "criminal mastermind", a wise Japanese father figure, a former special ops agent with "a penchant for trouble" and of course Idris Elba as wildcard. Yup, basically nailed it.

    In addition to the regurgitated non-plot there was just too much overdone CGI, too many cutesy/predictable/unoriginal comedic moments, too many cloyingly one-dimensional characters, too many cameos, and way too much brazen product placement.

    The coddling of the audience (nobody's _really_ dead!) was tiresome. The ~~water bottle montage~~ Fiji advertisement was unfortunately the best part of the movie.

    This episode was definitely saved by its ending. For the first three quarters I was put off by the obviously-too-obvious Netflix doppelganger, the weird fawning over Salma Hayek and the "quantum computers explain everything" plot justification.

    Then suddenly: _I am in this universe_ because I am watching Streamberry, Salma Hayek is playing herself but as would be written for a TV show, and quantum computers are an acceptable plot device where multiverses are involved. Bam!

    This is cleverly pragmatic storywriting too, because they can pawn off plot holes (i.e., that's _definitely_ not an enforceable contract) as being part of the worldbuilding from inside the TV episode.

    At first I was complimentary to Netflix for letting such an episode be made, but now I worry that they are so embedded in the culture that they can point out "lol we intentionally make TV to keep you selfish and addicted" and everyone will just laugh it off.

    The feel of the movie is very A24, [Saint Maud](#saint-maud-2019)-ish, due to the camerawork, editing and pacing. They like the "atmospheric" thing coupled with mostly-unsubtle visual metaphors/references/hints, with a bit of reading between the lines.

    The tension in this episode came from all the wrong places. Usually, Black Mirror episodes crank up the tension either by subjecting the characters to stresses until they break, or giving them time to realize their situation and take action. This episode had all the typical shallow pressures from crappy action movies, up to and including a car chase. It cheapens the plot.

    The "resurrection by technology" idea has been explored in several other Black Mirror episodes to much greater effect.

    The director said he was inspired after watching Inglorious Basterds, which you can really see in the increasing shamelessness and detachment from reality. Very fun, but like Inglorious Basterds, you have to roll with it (which took me about an hour into the movie to do).

    This is the first ~~Bollywood~~ [Tollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_cinema) movie I've seen in some time, so while I expected the dance numbers, I was was not prepared for the blunt exposition and saturated/airbrushed appearance of the entire movie. The writing and delivery of the British characters was quite poor, but I suppose that's because nobody gives a damn about what they have to say. I hope the Telugu was better, though some of the translations of the song lyrics were doing a whole lot of telling and not a lot of showing. Also, that friendship montage was incredible: borderline gay romance territory.

    By the way, their appearance at the end of the movie is apparently an explicit reference to their iconography in the culture. The [bow and arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluri_Sitarama_Raju) was not just for show.

    It's fun. Moviemaking-wise, my favorite aspect was the mirrored plotlines and the four girls being body doubles of sorts (especially since three of the four in the second half were playing stuntwomen). It was a bit slow at times.

    I figure that B movies like this peaked in the 70s, and nothing about the movie definitively identifies it as _not_ being in the 70s save for the clothing... until the cell phone comes out and they mention Lindsey Lohan. That was surprising and an unfortunately unnecessary dating of the movie since both details were irrelevant to the plot, but maybe that's the point? Do slasher movies date themselves awkwardly like that?

  more-thoughts: |
    "Eco-terrorism" has always felt like an extreme label broadly applied to any type of direct action, and I like that a movie like this can be made to explore one possible end state of groups like Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion.

    Yes, it is a bit preachy, but it's largely believable, with some allowances: Logan's tire-slashing/gunfire-dodging agility; Rowan's conning of the FBI; the physics of shutting off an oil pipeline; the economic/social/racial diversity of the small group. It's also definitely a bit cathartic, which might mean that it contributes to apathy regarding climate change. Think on that.

    I think that this movie can also be considered a translation for us moderns of why, say, the [Weather Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground) emerged: their issues were similarly pressing as climate change is to us now.

  dont-watch-this: because it's mostly filler with one-dimensional characters.
  more-thoughts: |
    This show leaned _really_ heavily into the "Nazi" part of "space Nazis", which are less compelling than real Nazis. The Designed in California prison subplot was ultimately zero sum (they were looking for him but didn't know they had him already, and he escaped and ended up alone anyway) and the Peter-Parker-looking Nazi boy scout didn't do anything the dominatrix in white couldn't have done by herself.

    I think this could have been a 3/4-episode miniseries that focused on how Mon Mothma and whoever Stellan Skarsgård is supported the storming of the base and how Andor ended up there. (This show definitely rewards those who kept track of every minor character in the main Star Wars plot lines.)

    Here's a very non-exhaustive list of the obvious-if-you-get-it-pointless-if-you-don't pure fan service references:

    - 6-eyed CCTV
    - PA microphone from the Death Star

    I could only make it through four of ten episodes. Even allowing for it being a character piece the pacing is far too slow, and the out-of-order storytelling is so overdone as to give the impression the writers are arbitrarily withholding information to be hostile (as opposed to, say, putting you in the shoes of a lost/confused character).

    In the Before, why is everyone immediately and absolutely convinced it's the literal apocalypse? I lived through real-life COVID where there was more fearmongering than here, and people didn't act like that. It ruins the effect. The show should know better, being made in 2021.

    The sets and especially costumes were fantastic, but not enough to bother watching (unlike, say, [The Cell](#the-cell-2000)). I also love the concept of a Mad Max-lite travelling troupe.

    Watch [The Last of Us](#the-last-of-us-2023) instead.

    This movie had a whole lot of foreshadowing, but almost all of it was quite subtle, like the cheap sunglasses sitting on the side table in the actor's house, which were very much not the focus of the scene.

    The final shot with the spider was at first scary, and then very quickly absurd. The spider was scared! I liked that the movie seemed to give you only the minimum about to piece together what happened, kind of like Memento. The final scene was then the rather abrupt challenge: "okay, now you figure it out!"

    I didn't really get why the whole movie was foggy and yellow. General mood, I guess?

    Casting was great; on screen chemistry between the two main actors was good. The story would plod at times, but I kept coming back for the aesthetics and because there were many individually good scenes, even in the slower episodes.

    For a modern show about a violent era, I thought it was relatively restrained in the use of sex and violence, the latter in particular well-used as a sharp accent when the story needed it.

    I didn't like the first episode all that much but was happy to stick with it. I would have preferred more palace intrigue and less romance. I like a show that inspires me to read up on the history of the thing!

    This was a good night's entertainment, well acted and really really tense, but I don't think it'll stick with me. The story is straightforward; it's small and messy and ill-conceived; it's probably closer than any thriller to how such a feud would play out. But it didn't get under my skin like, say, Green Room did.

    I consider this movie an object lesson in how guns can make mountains out of molehills. (Even though the first murder they showed was a stabbing, the original one, before the movie started, was a shooting too.) And, I suppose, that revenge is fleeting.

  more-thoughts: |
    There was a. lot. of sex in this movie, which I suppose makes sense since Bella is effectively a teenager in an adult's body for much of it. Taken individually, the sex scenes were amusing, but I was disappointed that they didn't clearly delineate a single era in Bella's life, like the black and white era, or the first-foray-into-the-real-world era. They blurred the remainder of the movie together. Not what I expected based on the first half hour.

    I saw a great quote from another review of this movie: just because something is anti-sexist, doesn't mean it's feminist. Framing empowerment through prostitution seems fraught, and the madame was more than a little exploitative herself.

    The guy who played Harry Astley was so, so flat in his delivery that I very quickly started to dread him ruining the scenes he was in. Was it intentional? Emma Stone though, she was incredible.

    I really like this movie as a dark, foul-mouthed interpretation of what a Wes Anderson movie could be.

  more-thoughts: |
    Most of this movie felt like a meditation on how bad sleep deprivation can get. (Or a toothache.) As it accelerated it became a bit like Requiem for a Dream Lite (Ellen Burstyn's character), complete with drugs, except in this case the hallucinations (?) were not drug-induced but a real (?) monster.

    In any case, the paranoia and uncertainty in the first half or two thirds were for sure the most compelling psychological horror part, but once the monster started showing up for real I lost interest. I don't know that it would have been any better if it used the "surprise it's just mental illness" escape hatch, though it set itself up for that. I thought the role reversal between mother and child was amusing. Almost as amusing as the Home Alone contraptions.

    An effect I liked in particular was right after the possession, when the mom is watching TV: the inability to focus and the quick twitches the camera makes are simple but effective.

    The first half is a legitimately scary movie, even if the snuff films started to get a bit overdone for little added effect. In particular, I like the way they explained away trope-y, spooky sounds with e.g. night terrors, or the way they demonstrated Ethan Hawke wasn't simply going crazy because other characters corroborated some apparently-supernatural happenings.

    It would have been a _significantly_ better movie if they had held the supernatural reveal until the box of movies reappears in the attic right before the end. You would have spent 95% of the movie scared about a murderous and superhumanly stealthly and methodical stalker, and then, twist, it actually _is_ supernatural and the children get Ringu'd into the home movies.

    I found this movie exhausting. As mentioned above, the characters are comtemptible, the commentary on Gen Z culture superficial and well-trodden, and the decision-making unrealistically awful. The only tolerable non-idiotic character was Lee Pace, and even then, merely tolerable.

    Had I known that the movie did not intend to take itself entirely seriously I would have gone in with different expectations, but I don't think that would have saved it. The few (in retrospect) genuinely funny lines would have registered as such, instead of coming off as the characters continuing to be obnoxious, but the juice just isn't worth the squeeze.

    This movie has aged great! By focusing on the insular island culture and minimizing intrusion from the outside, it created an environment frozen in time that focuses on people and interactions, and doesn't suffer from the "this would be done already if we had cell phones" problem.

    If it didn't invent all the folk-horror tropes, it certainly solidified them. Christopher Lee is fantastic, and in fact, he has said on several occasions that it was his favorite role. Midsommar owes so, so much to this movie. It's a tighter, higher-production-value movie, but The Wicker Man's simpler, more earnest style is a better fit for the "folk" part of "folk-horror".

    I assume in Japanese the name is a little less clunky. Do they have a single-syllable word for "one cut" so the name's cadence is closer to Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead or whatever?

    But after thinking on it for some time, it's grown on me, specifically _because_ it's such an out-there core concept in such mundane trappings. What a strange choice for a representation of... STDs? Sexual assault? Death? It's chilling how such an innocuous action -- literally, following -- taken to an extreme becomes so unsettling. Plus, I thought that the characters acted pretty reasonably given the insanity they were subjected to.

    I was convinced that this movie was about mental illness right up until the very end, but the real explanation is much more fun. (Ari Aster confirmed in an interview that there is no trick. It's what it says it is.) Just a perfectly balanced movie: freaky but believable people; unsettling but not outright hostile to the audience; a great reveal but not one that feels like a gotcha... And that decapitation scene: the perfect choice. We've all thought about it when we stick our hands out the car window.

    The daughter did remind me a lot of [Border](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5501104/).

    This movie feels like a lovely small-scale mashup of Primer and, I suppose, Clue. Or like game of hidden identity, except fun. Minimal props, minimal sets, minimal effects: just a bunch of people as confused as the audience trying to figure things out. I loved the idea that the alternate universes varied wildly from "nobody left the house and has any idea that anything is amiss" to "murder body doubles". Plus, blackouts are (usually) fun.

    Fun fact: the movie was filmed in a few days in the filmmaker's house, and he only gave each actor their own parts and only the parts they needed for _that day_ of filming. So they're as surprised as you are.

    Is the witch... the good guy? The family members were all pretty terrible to one another, and I can't entire blame Thomasin for deciding it would be better if she really _were_ a witch, if they were going to accuse her of it anyway. Most of them got what they deserved, I suppose.

  dont-watch-this: because it's just an okay ghost story that clashes with the Spanish Civil War backdrop.

    Ghosts are my least favorite kind of scare. They require a lot of suspension of disbelief but usually offer little storytelling oomph in return, often less than pagan gods, or witches, or zombies, or those sorts of things.

    I did like some elements and characters of this film, especially the older couple running the orphanage. The child actors are not bad, though the makeup on the ghost boy sure is. I wanted to like it more than I did, and it still feels a little harsh to recommend not watching it, but I'd pick most other horror movies on this list first, for sure.

  more-thoughts: |
    Yes, a thousand times yes, I adored this movie. The core supernatural concept was deliciously unsettling to the point where I almost regretted watching it alone in the dark. Framing the hand as a party drug was, to my knowledge, a unique approach that allowed to characters to behave like realistically risky, smartphone-wielding teenagers.

    The visual effects struck the perfect balance of creepy without going overboard, and the increasingly-unsubtle audio-visual cues of the possessive underworld woman were a nice touch.

  more-thoughts: |
    I love the self-imposed challenge of making a horror movie in broad daylight. I think folk horror, or at least, this strain of it, is all about the pacing, and Midsommar absolutely nails the pacing. You can't come on too quickly, otherwise you'd scare off the characters/audience who are largely pretty reasonable. Midsommar takes its time, but it never stops: the ramp-up is relentlessly steady; every scene just a little more weird than the last until you realize you're way past your comfort zone and how did we get here?

    This reminded me of The Man From Earth, at least before the killings started, but maybe that's just because that was the first low-budget chamber piece I saw. I'm surprised at how engaging this format could be: I was glued to the TV the whole time, even though the majority of the movie was just... talking. At a dinner party. I do that all the time on my own!

    This movie did remind me quite a bit of a small-scale Us, but it's different enough (and that's potentially spoiler-y enough) that I didn't mention it in the one-liner.

    What a mind fuck. This is Aronofsky at his finest. The thing that stuck out the most to me was the visual metaphors for euphoria, paranoia and hallucinations. The editing and camerawork for those did an excellent job conveying a _feeling_ that put you in the character's shoes.

    The parallel storylines showing four different versions of the same idea, and four different ways they can all go horribly wrong (and worse when they play off of each other), weave together into a surprisingly coherent storyline. At least, as coherent as it can be through the drug haze. I didn't even find the moral of the story too blunt: we all know where this leads, and the movie did all showing and no telling.

    Full disclosure: I was told, and went in expecting, that this was a horror movie. It's not. It starts out sort of like one, but once they figure out it's a UFO-alien, it becomes almost like a heist movie where you spend the first two thirds of the movie gathering the team and the equipment and the last third of the movie executing the heist. Which is fine, and kind of an interesting idea when mashed up like this, but I would rather they just did that from the start and made a different movie instead.

    There were some clever storywriting bits in the "heist" section of the movie, for sure, but the rules felt a little arbitrary and the I-guess-horror-related shots of the inside of the UFO-alien felt more gratuitous and irrelevant to the story than anything else.

    You know how you have that band where you love the first album, and you wish they would just do the same thing again? Some bands do, and it turns out that that's usually just boring. Some bands go the complete opposite direction and lose the plot. But some bands strike that perfect balance. Those are the best.

    Us is like Jordan Peele's perfect second follow up album to his #1 charting Get Out. It has a very similar feel but otherwise bears no relation. It's got quite a bit of worldbuilding, and the fantastical bent of it permits the more overtly weird aspects -- like the scissors, or the raspy voices -- to blend and contribute rather than stick out as awkward. I really liked the raspy voices in particular: how creepy, that you talk so little that you aren't even sure how to do it properly anymore.

    I loved that the show stayed true to the game. I wanted to like the game-as-story more than I did, but the uncanny valley was too strong for me. Having it done live action and non-interactively (so the pacing and delivery can be perfected) is definitely what the doctor ordered. The casting is excellent all around.

    This show did everything right that the Walking Dead did wrong. The zombies are scarier and used more effectively and convincingly (instead of treated as necessary nuisance for the setting), and the tight focus on only one complex relationship is far more compelling than a glorified soap opera ensemble cast.

    It is worth watching even if you've played the game and didn't have uncnany valley problems with it, if only to relive the game.

    This was a good night's entertainment, well acted and really really tense, but I don't think it'll stick with me. The story is straightforward; it's small and messy and ill-conceived; it's probably closer than any thriller to how such a feud would play out. But it didn't get under my skin like, say, Green Room did.

    I consider this movie an object lesson in how guns can make mountains out of molehills. (Even though the first murder they showed was a stabbing, the original one, before the movie started, was a shooting too.) And, I suppose, that revenge is fleeting.

    There was a. lot. of sex in this movie, which I suppose makes sense since Bella is effectively a teenager in an adult's body for much of it. Taken individually, the sex scenes were amusing, but I was disappointed that they didn't clearly delineate a single era in Bella's life, like the black and white era, or the first-foray-into-the-real-world era. They blurred the remainder of the movie together. Not what I expected based on the first half hour.

    I saw a great quote from another review of this movie: just because something is anti-sexist, doesn't mean it's feminist. Framing empowerment through prostitution seems fraught, and the madame was more than a little exploitative herself.

    The guy who played Harry Astley was so, so flat in his delivery that I very quickly started to dread him ruining the scenes he was in. Was it intentional? Emma Stone though, she was incredible.

    I really like this movie as a dark, foul-mouthed interpretation of what a Wes Anderson movie could be.

  dont-watch-this-because: the best parts are done better by Requiem for a Dream.
  more-thoughts: |
    Most of this movie felt like a meditation on how bad sleep deprivation can get. (Or a toothache.) As it accelerated it became a bit like Requiem for a Dream Lite (Ellen Burstyn's character), complete with drugs, except in this case the hallucinations (?) were not drug-induced but a real (?) monster.

    In any case, the paranoia and uncertainty in the first half or two thirds were for sure the most compelling psychological horror part, but once the monster started showing up for real I lost interest. I don't know that it would have been any better if it used the "surprise it's just mental illness" escape hatch, though it set itself up for that. I thought the role reversal between mother and child was amusing. Almost as amusing as the Home Alone contraptions.

    An effect I liked in particular was right after the possession, when the mom is watching TV: the inability to focus and the quick twitches the camera makes are simple but effective.

    I didn't know this was [King Lear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear) when I sat down to watch it, but even then it was very, very apparent that it was a screen<i>play</i> more than it was a movie. There's nothing wrong with that, but it does have play-like storytelling in that there is a lot of telling instead of showing.

    The set pieces are absolutely incredible. Lots and lots of horses, yes, but the king wandering out of the burning castle while the armies part to let him pass... yowza. They really built and burned a full-size set for that.

    The first half is a legitimately scary movie, even if the snuff films started to get a bit overdone for little added effect. In particular, I like the way they explained away trope-y, spooky sounds with e.g. night terrors, or the way they demonstrated Ethan Hawke wasn't simply going crazy because other characters corroborated some apparently-supernatural happenings.

    It would have been a significantly better movie if they had held the supernatural reveal until the box of movies reappears in the attic right before the end. You would have spent 95% of the movie scared about a murderous and superhumanly stealthly and methodical stalker, and then, twist, it actually _is_ supernatural and the children get Ringu'd into the home movies.

    I love love love Dune, and think that the movies are an excellent transfer to the screen because they hew so closely to the books at all times.

    I found this movie exhausting. As mentioned above, the characters are comtemptible, the commentary on Gen Z culture superficial and well-trodden, and the decision-making unrealistically awful. The only tolerable non-idiotic character was Lee Pace, and even then, merely tolerable.

    Had I known that the movie did not intend to take itself entirely seriously I would have gone in with different expectations, but I don't think that would have saved it. The few (in retrospect) genuinely funny lines would have registered as such, instead of coming off as the characters continuing to be obnoxious, but the juice just isn't worth the squeeze.

    This movie has aged great! By focusing on the insular island culture and minimizing intrusion from the outside, it created an environment frozen in time that focuses on people and interactions, and doesn't suffer from the "this would be done already if we had cell phones" problem.

    If it didn't invent all the folk-horror tropes, it certainly solidified them. Christopher Lee is fantastic, and in fact, he has said on several occasions that it was his favorite role. Midsommar owes so, so much to this movie. It's a tighter, higher-production-value movie, but The Wicker Man's simpler, more earnest style is a better fit for the "folk" part of "folk-horror".

    I fully expected the twist in this movie to be that Ralph Fiennes would feed guests to each other, or previous guests to these guests, or something trope-y like that. But when they served The Mess, I knew I was in for a ride.

    I adored the parodical food-porn glamour shots of each dish and the heavy-handed criticism of haute cuisine and the culture around it, in particular, Ralph Fiennes browbeating the insufferable "foodie" into killing himself from shame. Crazy. Head waiter Elsa was also excellently written and acted.

    I assume in Japanese the name is a little less clunky. Do they have a single-syllable word for "one cut" so the name's cadence is closer to Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead or whatever?

    I didn't like this movie when I first watched it. It felt corny, forced, too far outside the realm of believability but without the rest of the trappings (and benefits) of a more out-there plot.

    But after thinking on it for some time, it's grown on me, specifically _because_ it's such an out-there core concept in such mundane trappings. What a strange choice for a representation of... STDs? Sexual assault? Death? It's chilling how such an innocuous action -- literally, following -- taken to an extreme becomes so unsettling. Plus, I thought that the characters acted pretty reasonably given the insanity they were subjected to.

    What a mind fuck. This is Aronofsky at his finest. The thing that stuck out the most to me was the visual metaphors for euphoria, paranoia and hallucinations. The editing and camerawork for those did an excellent job conveying a _feeling_ that put you in the character's shoes.

    The parallel storylines showing four different versions of the same idea, and four different ways they can all go horribly wrong (and worse when they play off of each other), weave together into a surprisingly coherent storyline. At least, as coherent as it can be through the drug haze. I didn't even find the moral of the story too blunt: we all know where this leads, and the movie did all showing and no telling.

    Full disclosure: I was told, and went in expecting, that this was a horror movie. It's not. It starts out sort of like one, but once they figure out it's a UFO-alien, it becomes almost like a heist movie where you spend the first two thirds of the movie gathering the team and the equipment and the last third of the movie executing the heist. Which is fine, and kind of an interesting idea when mashed up like this, but I would rather they just did that from the start and made a different movie instead.

    There were some clever storywriting bits in the "heist" section of the movie, for sure, but the rules felt a little arbitrary and the I-guess-horror-related shots of the inside of the UFO-alien felt more gratuitous and irrelevant to the story than anything else.

    Us is like Jordan Peele's perfect second follow up album to his #1 charting Get Out. It has a very similar feel but otherwise bears no relation. It's got quite a bit of worldbuilding, and the fantastical bent of it permits the more overtly weird aspects -- like the scissors, or the raspy voices -- to blend and contribute rather than stick out as awkward. I really liked the raspy voices in particular: how creepy, that you talk so little that you aren't even sure how to do it properly anymore.

  </header><p>Everyone likes to claim that the drivers where they come from are the worst, but we can’t all be right. I think the problem is that we’re talking past each other: there are different ways to be a bad driver.</p>

<p>I hereby propose a rating system with three axes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>incompetence</strong></li>
  <li><strong>negligence</strong></li>
  <li><strong>aggression</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some example applications for some places I’m familiar with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>NorCal:</strong> incompetent and negligent, but emphatically passive</li>
  <li><strong>Italy:</strong> hyper-aggressive, but by and large competent and usually attentive</li>
  <li><strong>New York City:</strong> all sliders to <em>maximum</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I think disagreements happen when your bad drivers and their bad drivers are at even moderately-different positions along these axes.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while it’s obvious that minimal incompetence and minimal negligence is objectively good, the same is not true for aggression. Drivers that are too passive cause traffic flow problems and annoy other drivers – rightfully, I’d say, if you won’t pull into the intersection on green when you’re waiting to turn left.</p>

        This filthy trick makes sure that the content always weakly tries to expand to the full
        width available, but allows for linebreaks if the viewport is too small. It produces a
        better result than, say, width: 100%; or width: some-fixed-pixel-amount; and doesn't require
        rewriting everything to flexbox (which would mess with the <html>-level scroll behavior and
        sticky header) or adding extra DOM (which I'm trying to minimize to make myself feel good).

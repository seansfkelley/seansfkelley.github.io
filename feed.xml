<p>I previously used (and adored) one of <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">these</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/glove80/ergodox.jpg" alt="ErgoDox" /></p>

<p>This post is a review of the Glove80 with frequent comparisons to the ErgoDox, since it was my baseline for years.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="feel">Feel</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The housing is nicely minimalist, with no chin or forehead.</strong></p>

    <p>I appreciate this type of minimalism. Large expanses of empty housing like on a regular keyboard, or even the thick (vertically) and slightly wider (horizontally) housing on an ErgoDox makes it feel like an ungainly behemoth in comparison. This does have the unintended side effect of making the carrying case feel even more enormous than it already objectively is. (More on that later.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The halves are so light that they don’t dampen vibrations very well.</strong></p>

    <p>This is relative and not terribly noticeable until you switch back to another keyboard that does. It’s a bit like being in a room that echoes slightly and not noticing until you go to a room that dampens echoes properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The low profile keys are quieter and a little mushier than mechnical keyboards with keys that bottom out.</strong></p>

    <p>The keys are <em>way</em> less satisfying to strike than the heavy bottoming-out you get on more standard mechanical keyboards like the ErgoDox. Since they don’t bottom out, using non-clicky switches will make the keyboard almost silent, which is a nice option if you’re into that. If you aren’t, consider using clicky switches if you’re not normally the type to.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The integrated wrist rests are slippery and too small for those with large hands.</strong></p>

    <p>My palms dangle off the near edge of the wrist rests. This would be tolerable, but not great, except that they’re also pretty smooth so I’m constantly aware of my hands’ positioning in order to keep them from slipping off the near edge. I actually use the huge rubber brick wrist rests that came with the ErgoDox, which I love, and have disconnected the integrated rests. It’s a shame, because having exactly two pieces in total to wrangle would be really nice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="build-quality">Build Quality</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The housing design is prone to damage and seems to be made of relatively soft plastic.</strong></p>

    <p>I accidentally dropped one half a couple inches onto the desk and now there are permanently dulled corners with obvious damage. I don’t know why they didn’t bevel it like the ErgoDox to avoid this kind of damage. Pieces of the case aren’t completely flush with one another, though that’s only on the bottom where it’s usually out of sight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The low profile switches and keycaps rattle slightly when you move the keyboard around.</strong></p>

    <p>The rattling only happens when moving it around, not when typing, but every time I pick it up to pack it it reminds me that it feels a little cheap. The ErgoDox does not rattle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The carrying case that it comes with is very nice, if bulky.</strong></p>

    <p>The two halves fit very snugly into their molded holders and there’s a little room to spare for replacement parts and the relevant tools (like the keycap puller). I would not trust the keyboard to survive unprotected in a backpack or duffel, so the case is a welcome addition. On the other hand, the ErgoDox is indestructible and is therefore in some ways easier to travel with, despite all the associated bits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The switches (and PCB?) are easily broken when replacing keycaps.</strong></p>

    <p>I broke one within a week by pulling out the keycaps too hard (which, to be fair, they warn you about). The keycaps <em>really</em> grip the switches and can jostle the switches around when being replaced, and unlike the ErgoDox the switches aren’t hot-swappable. It was a two-week affair to buy replacements and get a friend to solder it on, but it broke again within a month (PCB damage?) so I just stopped using that location. I broke a couple switches on my ErgoDox but never had to change my keymap to compensate since they could be hot-swapped.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The concavity takes a while to get used to, but makes <em>so many keys</em> available.</strong></p>

    <p>This is the first concave keyboard I’ve owned. It wasn’t difficult to get passably efficient, but it took a couple months before I stopped hitting adjacent keys by accident because they were closer than I was used to. In exchange, every finger gets comfortable access to 5 keys (doubled, for the index/pinky, them being on the edge) compared to the 3-4 on the ErgoDox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The per-finger curvature and offset is <em>excellent</em>, excepting the pinky which should be more curved.</strong></p>

    <p>For the index/middle/ring fingers, all keys feel equally reachable without any preference for the middle finger (it being longer). The pinky is alright, but the second-from-top row is a stretch for it. I would have preferred they curve the pinky column more aggressively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The thumb clusters give only three keys for regular use, but the other three are still comfortable to reach.</strong></p>

    <p>The lower row of thumb keys seems to be intended as the primary one. The upper row requires a small shift of your whole hand to strike fully, though you can graze the innermost upper row key without doing that. The top row is still useful, just for less-frequent keys. The three primary keys are as comfortable as those on the ErgoDox.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>One fewer column on the inner edge is not a problem.</strong></p>

    <p>I liked the big 1.5u keys on the inner columns of the ErgoDox because I could lift my hand and slap them with minimal precision. They were useful for symmetric, rare keys like brackets. The Glove80 takes this away, but since many more keys are reachable with the concavity, you can just bind those keys to the bottommost row, which is the most awkward but still way more reachable than those inner columns were.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The top row is only useful for rarely-used keys.</strong></p>

    <p>It’s too far, except for maybe the middle finger. That’s probably why it defaults to function keys.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="convenience">Convenience</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The wireless inter-keyboard connection is flawless.</strong></p>

    <p>In three months of using the keyboard every day, I have only had the two halves unable to communicate with each other once when I made a mistake while flashing firmware. It just works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Having four Bluetooth connections makes it easy to use my keyboard everywhere.</strong></p>

    <p>I have three computers that I use this keyboard with regularly, so having a dedicated connection for each I can switch between with a single keystroke allows me to use my preferred keyboard with a minimum of fuss. The four-color status indicators are a nice bonus too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Battery life is good but not incredible.</strong></p>

    <p>I’m used to a wired keyboard, so having any battery life to worry about at all is a downgrade. The battery life is measured in weeks, which is long enough to not be a problem but feels short compared to e.g. my mouse, whose battery life is measured in months. I would have preferred a heavier keyboard for unrelated reasons, so adding that weight with a larger battery would have been a win-win in my mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>USB-C yes please.</strong></p>

    <p>No proprietary USB A Logitech dongles, no ErgoDox USB mini-B nonsense (that’s right: <em>not</em> micro-B; do you even remember mini-B?). Everything in my life must be USB-C.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ZMK firmware is a big step up from QMK, even though it’s missing features.</strong></p>

    <p>ZMK was significantly easier for me to pick up and run with than QMK. In particular, it’s much more composable, with a strong macro system that allows combining a library of “behaviors” in infinite ways. Unfortunately ZMK does not have useful mouse key support, so I had to fork it to pull in some unstable code from other people and pile on my own kinda hacky implementations to match the QMK behaviors that I like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The extra Windows/Linux/Mac/”nerd” keycap sets are a nice touch.</strong></p>

    <p>The manufacturer sells keycaps with the Mac command symbol, Tux the penguin, Vim-style HJKL, etc. As you can see in the picture at the top, I currently use a mish-mash of symbols from different places, which I like. I don’t know how hard it is to find custom keycaps that fit these switches, though the switches themselves seem to be a little hard to find.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The switches are soldered, so make the right choice the first time.</strong></p>

    <p>I think I would have preferred clicky switches, but I can’t change them now with resoldering every single key, which sounds like a recipe for breakage. (Well, more than I already broke it by replacing some keycaps.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The manufacturers are cagey about sharing hardware diagrams despite advertising third-party hardware customizations on the site.</strong></p>

    <p>I wanted to try 3D printing extra-long integrated wrist rests for my large hands, but while I did get a quick response on the manufacturer’s Discord<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> when asking for the necessary measurements to properly line up the screw holes, they clearly did not want to share anything specific nor admit that they didn’t want to share anything specific. It quickly became radio silence.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Glove80 resolves all of the ErgoDox’s issues with bulk, layout and accessories while keeping (or providing slight upgrades to!) most of the ErgoDox’s comfort and customizability features. It’s clearly trying to appeal to both average users and keyboard hackers, which sometimes ends up in tradeoffs favoring the average user, such as portability over big clacky keys. It’s noticeably less robust than the ErgoDox, and may not be as comfortable if you have large hands.</p>

<p>If the Glove80 is under consideration for your first serious ergonomic keyboard, buy it, though note that learning a split, concave and columnar layout without any prior experience takes a while.</p>

<p>If you already have a keyboard collection, this is definitely a worthy addition.</p>

<p>If you’re attracted to mechnical clackfests but want something that won’t give you instant RSI, you might be better of with the ErgoDox or something in that family.</p>

During this review, I was struck by a thought and finally able to articulate why I don’t like Redux:</p>

<p>Redux is a design pattern, not a library.</p>

<p>The core of Redux maps directly onto, and is largely implemented by, language-level features:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>reducers: switch + object spread</li>
  <li>actions: discriminated unions (a language-level feature in TypeScript)</li>
  <li>action creators: object literals/constructors</li>
  <li>middleware: higher-order functions/decorators</li>
  <li>dispatch: function call</li>
  <li>store: just… a plain object</li>
</ul>

<p>Redux-the-library doesn’t actually <em>do</em> anything significant; instead, it merely assigns roles and new names to existing language features. Indeed, when Dan Abramov was still involved in it, one of his frequent selling points was that it was <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367">more of an idea than anything else, and so simple that you could even just implement it yourself</a>…</p>

<p>…which is exactly what you’re supposed to do with a design pattern. Have you ever seen a library for the visitor pattern? No you haven’t, because a design pattern doesn’t have enough meat on the bones to be a library. A design pattern doesn’t save work, abstract away complexity or add expressivity. A design pattern guides you in writing the same amount of code you would have without it, but with fewer traps. That’s Redux-the-library in a nutshell.</p>

<p>It is this misinterpretation of Redux as a library that leads to the overengineered, overabstract boilerplate I associate with the ecosystem of things built upon it. Redux-the-library wraps these expressive language-level constructs into restrictive, supposedly-but-not-really higher-level primitives that other things in the Redux ecosystem attempt to build on. But it doesn’t work: there’s no <em>there</em> there, and most of them (thunks and middlewares and sagas, oh my) also end up being design patterns in disguise, with all the attendant implementation work for their users.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: there is nothing inherently wrong with a library mandating the use of restrictive primitives to interact with it. But this is a cost for using it, and in the case of Redux-the-library, there is no benefit in exchange for this cost, because Redux-the-pattern is too simple for Redux-the-library to offer meaningful expressivity or code savings. I would even say that Redux-the-library is <em>competing</em> with the host language rather than complementing it, replacing usefully context-aware expression of Redux-the-pattern’s ideas with a verbose one-size-fits-all implementation of those ideas.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So much of programming is creating abstractions that operate on higher-level primitives. And while it’s true that by moving your solution one rung higher on the abstraction ladder you can solve a broader swath of related problems, it’s also true that your solution then becomes less expressive and ergonomic in the context from which it was born. This might be okay; finding the correct degree of abstraction is a lot of the art of programming. But if you pursue abstraction for its own sake, you end up writing a programming language inside your programming language or <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/opinion-pieces/bad-carma/">a database schema that can represent any other database schema</a>. The abstraction “collapses”, in a sense, to nothing at all. You end up right where you began, but months later and stuck trying to solve anything other than the original problem in your half-baked non-framework.</p>

      <p>The only core Redux concept missing from this list is selectors, which do not correspond directly to a language-level feature, but “composable memoized pure function implementing a view of a value” is not a novel idea. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Originally this post was just me venting about Redux, but I relegated the remainder of that to this (long) footnote and tried to chop it down a bit. Enjoy an entire bonus post, I guess.</p>

      <p>I suspect a lot of the people involved in the major Redux ecosystem libraries had never heard the phrases “state transition”, “pure function” or “copy on write” before and thought that Redux (both pattern and library) was some kind of generational innovation rather than a textbook example of what those things mean when applied to idiomatic JavaScript. Just another example of web developers rediscovering things that other developers have known for a long time. (n.b. I am also a web developer, I guess.)</p>

      <p>Nobody in the ecosystem seems to notice that the only way to open source any of the abstractions they’ve built in-house is to strip them of all opinions and publish a bunch of wrapper functions or reimplementations of existing language constructs, collectively christened with some new name. After all, you can’t open source <em>your</em> action creators, but you can open source, uh, a function that makes functions that put all their arguments into an object literal.</p>

      <p>The towering momuments to abstraction that inevitably emerge when Redux-the-library is used in nontrivial applications ironically end up being as unpleasant to read and write as what you’d have ended up with if you reached for the first thing that comes to mind <em>without</em> Redux-the-pattern, i.e., a massive, mutable global state singleton. Except: the Redux version is smeared across dozens of files and several libraries. Did you know Dan Abramov <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/dsfio6/comment/f6pmgmj/">never used Redux in any production application</a>? In fact, Dan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/dsfio6/comment/f6p4krr/">really doesn’t like Redux anymore</a>.</p>

      <p>A little tangentially, have you ever seen the types for Redux and Redux-adajacent libraries? I mean, <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/blob/0246f788ef964a6afb5071f5b9a651d48630f3e0/packages/toolkit/src/configureStore.ts#L118-L126">look</a> <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/a128c5ebb30bda6e60d597dc37ab97992f8e0d8d/src/types.ts#L110-L124">at</a> <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/blob/1223a1b0997a6b248ccbac3ba4e2a544a7a676d8/src/createSelectorCreator.ts#L80-L104">these</a>.

It’s a mental health hit-and-run, perpetrated one honk at a time.</p>

<p>Just yesterday I was talking about that utterly ridiculous attempt by BMW to make seat heaters a subscription (which they <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/bmw-relents-on-heated-seat-subscription.html">cancelled</a>, by the way, so don’t worry).</p>

<p>Then it hit me: what if there was a subscription model for honking? Like car insurance, a honking subscription would be compulsory, and in order to have the desired effect, it would be pay-per-use. There’s a ton of variations and angles here.</p>

<p>One Very Important Detail for the plan is the payment method: you could only pay in person with cash or check, perhaps at the local DMV or USPS, and you have to do it once a month. If you’re going to be obnoxious and petty, the system is going to be obnoxious and petty back. As a bonus, this also ensures that rich people can’t pay their way out of being dicks.</p>

<p>I know you have questions. I have answered all of them below.</p>

<h2 id="compulsory-honking-usage-fee-faq">Compulsory Honking Usage Fee FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>How would you keep people from working around the car counting honks?</strong> The same way BMW was going to make sure people paid for seat heaters. I’m sure you could hack around it, but I’ll take a 99% compliance rate any day of the week.</p>

<p><strong>Wouldn’t this end up as a regressive tax on the poor?</strong> I guess technically, but if the goal is to inconvenience people more than make them pay, you can put a really low cap on it. Like $5/month low. We don’t want people’s cars getting repossessed over this.</p>

<p><strong>What if someone didn’t pay?</strong> A fine, proportional to your income, like the way Sweden does speeding tickets. Again, don’t want rich people to pay their way out.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do to prevent people from going hog wild on the horn after they reach the monthly cap?</strong> Unfortunately, nothing. It won’t be worse than now, except when you hear it you know that person is going to have to stand in line at the DMV for hours later this month.</p>

<p><strong>What if you only honk a really tiny amount, like once a month?</strong> Everyone gets some freebies every month, which also protects against inadvertent honking. Like the compliance rate, the goal here is masssive reduction, not total elimination.</p>

<p><strong>Won’t people think twice before using their horn for safety?</strong> What safety? Maybe you get a permit, like a parking permit, for X honks/day if you live near a registered blind curve.

<p><strong>What if someone just leans on the horn for a really long time, so it’s only one count?</strong> You could add a honk count for every, say, 1 full second the horn is held down. With a low monthly cap, the point of the count is to get the gist of the severity. It’s not a thorough audit. They’ll definitely still exhaust their freebies this way.</p>

<p><strong>What about all the bureaucracy this would create?</strong> Maybe the program would pay for itself. It’s not exactly intended to be a for-profit endeavour. Alternately: it wouldn’t be the first time the government pays out to <em>stop</em> people from doing something. And this way, we would get peace and quiet instead of, uh, less corn, or soybeans, or whatever.</p>

Remember how they would mess with your intuition, that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram#Paradoxes">silhouettes they drew seemed to lie</a>?</p>

<p>I’m working on a large refactor that is composed of two similarly-sized and similarly-structured systems. Let’s imagine these systems as two similar tangram tiles.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="71px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 0.707 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,0.707 0.707,0.707 0.707,0" />
  </svg>

  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 1,1 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>You can arrange these in a variety of ways, some more aesthetically appealing or easily described than others.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="150px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1.5 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,1 1.5 0.5" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 1,0 1,1" />
  </svg>
  <svg width="171px" height="100px" viewBox="-0.707 0 1.707 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 -0.707,1 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,1" />
  </svg>
  <svg width="141px" height="121px" viewBox="-0.707 -0.707 1.414 1.207">
    <polygon class="one" points="-0.5,0 0.5,0 0,0.5" />
    <polygon class="two" points="-0.707,0 0.707,0 0,-0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>And so it was that I found myself with a software architecture resembling this configuration…</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 0,0 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>The smaller shape represents the underlying domain-agnostic framework for the whole system. Call it the <span class="one">foundation</span>. The larger one is where all the business rules and domain logic lives. Call it the <span class="two">superstructure</span>.</p>

<p>This shape looks unstable and un-elegant. In this analogy, the <span class="one">foundation</span> sort-of supports the <span class="two">superstructure</span> in that it’s mostly on the bottom, but parts of it end up pretty high up where a “<span class="one">foundation</span>” probably shouldn’t reach. On the other end, the pointy bit that sticks out on the bottom is where the <span class="two">superstructure</span> bypasses the <span class="one">foundation</span> completely, which suggests the <span class="one">foundation</span> isn’t providing what the <span class="two">superstructure</span> needs. Plus, the entire system doesn’t sit flat.</p>

<p>Through years of organic software growth, these two systems had developed into this configuration that was difficult to change without risking even more instability.</p>

<p>I considered a few methods to rearrange the shapes that could resolve the instability and awkwardness.</p>

<p>Trying to shift the <span class="two">superstructure</span> higher up without fundamentally changing its shape, so that the <span class="one">foundation</span> could at least actually serve as the base and the whole thing could sit flat, was a lot of work against gravity (if you’ll permit the mixed metaphors) and still ends up with pointy bits sticking out, just elsewhere.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 0.707,1 0.707,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Moving entire pieces from one side to the other, like this example from earlier, would be a lot of effort for little gain.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="171px" height="100px" viewBox="-0.707 0 1.707 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 -0.707,1 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>I tried to think outside the box a bit: I could shift responsibility from the <span class="two">superstructure</span> to the <span class="one">foundation</span> to make the entire system bottom-heavy again. This would still require moving a lot of mass around, even if it isn’t going very far. And it isn’t even clear if this is a meaningful improvement.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 1,1 1,0" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 0,0.292 0.707,0.292" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>After some more aborted out-of-the-box ideas, I decided the best course of action would be to sand off the pointy bits and deal with the remaining, irregularly-shaped pieces that still got too close to the tops and bottoms where they shouldn’t. At least it would be a rectangle that sits flat.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0.707 0,0 1,0 0.292,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>That rectangle sparked an idea. Consider the silhouette – the view from the outside – of the entire system.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="silhouette" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707 0,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Hey… you can construct that with these pieces instead!</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0,0.707" />
    <polygon class="four" points="0,0.707 0.292,0.707 0,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>This layout is still a little awkward, but the relationship of the silhouette to the parts that make it up is <em>much less surprising</em>! And all we had to do to get here is to redraw the lines between the shapes. All the mass stayed where it was. We have rearchitected the system away from one where everything was just a little bit wrong to one where the <span class="three">core</span> is highly regular and it just has some <span class="four">hacks</span> bolted onto it. (Ah, software in the real world.)</p>

<p>It’s now a lot easier to move the <span class="four">hacks</span> around and change the silhouette, since it has relatively little connection to the <span class="three">core</span>. If we want to make a change to the silhouette for some reason (that is: the system, holistically, as seen from the outside), we can do it with less effort and more flexibility.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="158px" height="71px" viewBox="-0.292 0 1.584 0.707">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0,0.707" />
    <polygon class="four" points="1,0.707 1.292,0.707 1,0.414" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Now it lies flat.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,1 1,1 1,0.292 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="four" points="0.292,0.292 0.707,0.292 0.5,0.094" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Now it lies flat <em>and</em> is symmetrical, so the <span class="four">hacks</span> don’t grate quite as much. The possibilities are endless, and with some effort, we could even restructure the <span class="three">core</span> to elegantly subsume all the mass from the <span class="four">hacks</span> – there isn’t that much of it!</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="106px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.060 0.707">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1.060,0 1.060,0.707 0,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>(Yes: it is ever so slightly wider. Conservation of mass, and all that.)</p>

<p>Let’s rewind a bit. What if we <em>did</em> put in the effort to move the original tiles around without redrawing the lines or moving mass between them?</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="141px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="0.707,0.707 1.414,0 1.414,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0.707,0.707 1.414,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>In a silhouette, that looks like this.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="141px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="silhouette" points="0,0 1.414,0 1.414,0.707 0.707,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>You might be able to see where this is going.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="141px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="five" points="0.707,0 1.414,0 1.414,0.707 0.707,0.707" />
    <polygon class="six" points="0,0 0.707,0 0.707,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>A different architecture! Like the other one, it’s not really a two-layer architecture anymore. The precence of the <span class="five">square</span> is an improvement, since squares have even less variability to consider than rectangles. There’s still a <span class="six">triangle</span> sticking out the side, but it matches the side of the <span class="five">square</span> perfectly: a good abstraction boundary, perhaps? Say: a minimal but fully-expressive API that is used mostly at a high level, but doesn’t prevent consumers from using the low-level parts when necessary. That sounds like a practial design to me.</p>

<p>The refactor isn’t done yet, but at least now I have a plan that is realistic, relatively less effort, and has a long-term path towards something halfway decent. Thanks, tangrams.</p>

        <p>This movie had a whole lot of foreshadowing, but almost all of it was quite subtle, like the cheap sunglasses sitting on the side table in the actor’s house, which were very much not the focus of the scene.</p>

        <p>The final shot with the spider was at first scary, and then very quickly absurd. The spider was scared! I liked that the movie seemed to give you only the minimum about to piece together what happened, kind of like Memento. The final scene was then the rather abrupt challenge: “okay, now you figure it out!”</p>

        <p>I didn’t really get why the whole movie was foggy and yellow. General mood, I guess?</p>

        <p>Casting was great; on screen chemistry between the two main actors was good. The story would plod at times, but I kept coming back for the aesthetics and because there were many individually good scenes, even in the slower episodes.</p>

        <p>For a modern show about a violent era, I thought it was relatively restrained in the use of sex and violence, the latter in particular well-used as a sharp accent when the story needed it.</p>

        <p>I didn’t like the first episode all that much but was happy to stick with it. I would have preferred more palace intrigue and less romance. I like a show that inspires me to read up on the history of the thing!</p>

        <p>This was a good night’s entertainment, well acted and really really tense, but I don’t think it’ll stick with me. The story is straightforward; it’s small and messy and ill-conceived; it’s probably closer than any thriller to how such a feud would play out. But it didn’t get under my skin like, say, Green Room did.</p>

        <p>I consider this movie an object lesson in how guns can make mountains out of molehills. (Even though the first murder they showed was a stabbing, the original one, before the movie started, was a shooting too.) And, I suppose, that revenge is fleeting.</p>

        <p>There was a. lot. of sex in this movie, which I suppose makes sense since Bella is effectively a teenager in an adult’s body for much of it. Taken individually, the sex scenes were amusing, but I was disappointed that they didn’t clearly delineate a single era in Bella’s life, like the black and white era, or the first-foray-into-the-real-world era. They blurred the remainder of the movie together. Not what I expected based on the first half hour.</p>

        <p>I saw a great quote from another review of this movie: just because something is anti-sexist, doesn’t mean it’s feminist. Framing empowerment through prostitution seems fraught, and the madame was more than a little exploitative herself.</p>

        <p>The guy who played Harry Astley was so, so flat in his delivery that I very quickly started to dread him ruining the scenes he was in. Was it intentional? Emma Stone though, she was incredible.</p>

        <p>I really like this movie as a dark, foul-mouthed interpretation of what a Wes Anderson movie could be.</p>

As it accelerated it became a bit like Requiem for a Dream Lite (Ellen Burstyn’s character), complete with drugs, except in this case the hallucinations (?) were not drug-induced but a real (?) monster.</p>

        <p>In any case, the paranoia and uncertainty in the first half or two thirds were for sure the most compelling psychological horror part, but once the monster started showing up for real I lost interest. I don’t know that it would have been any better if it used the “surprise it’s just mental illness” escape hatch, though it set itself up for that. I thought the role reversal between mother and child was amusing. Almost as amusing as the Home Alone contraptions.</p>

        <p>An effect I liked in particular was right after the possession, when the mom is watching TV: the inability to focus and the quick twitches the camera makes are simple but effective.</p>

        <p>I didn’t know this was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear">King Lear</a> when I sat down to watch it, but even then it was very, very apparent that it was a screen<i>play</i> more than it was a movie. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it does have play-like storytelling in that there is a lot of telling instead of showing.</p>

        <p>The set pieces are absolutely incredible. Lots and lots of horses, yes, but the king wandering out of the burning castle while the armies part to let him pass… yowza. They really built and burned a full-size set for that.</p>

        <p>This was a very pretty, if visually austere, movie. I see why people like it, but as you might guess from the one-liner, I’m pretty tired of having this conversation. You end up getting it a lot as a tech nerd.</p>

        <p>I don’t think the rise of LLMs has changed my thoughts on this movie one way or the other. Ultimately more plausible, perhaps, but they neither undermine nor support the thesis of the movie. That might be a comment more on LLMs themselves than this movie or AI generally.</p>

        <p>The first half is a legitimately scary movie, even if the snuff films started to get a bit overdone for little added effect. In particular, I like the way they explained away trope-y, spooky sounds with e.g. night terrors, or the way they demonstrated Ethan Hawke wasn’t simply going crazy because other characters corroborated some apparently-supernatural happenings.</p>

        <p>It would have been a significantly better movie if they had held the supernatural reveal until the box of movies reappears in the attic right before the end. You would have spent 95% of the movie scared about a murderous and superhumanly stealthly and methodical stalker, and then, twist, it actually <em>is</em> supernatural and the children get Ringu’d into the home movies.</p>

        <p>I love love love Dune, and think that the movies are an excellent transfer to the screen because they hew so closely to the books at all times.</p>

        <p>This one is a little less exciting for not-already-Dune-fans, and even already-Dune-fans, because it doesn’t get to introduce all the wild world-building and main characters, like the first one did. It’s still absolutely worth rewatching, though probably as part of a marathon.</p>

        <p>I found this movie exhausting. As mentioned above, the characters are comtemptible, the commentary on Gen Z culture superficial and well-trodden, and the decision-making unrealistically awful. The only tolerable non-idiotic character was Lee Pace, and even then, merely tolerable.</p>

        <p>Had I known that the movie did not intend to take itself entirely seriously I would have gone in with different expectations, but I don’t think that would have saved it. The few (in retrospect) genuinely funny lines would have registered as such, instead of coming off as the characters continuing to be obnoxious, but the juice just isn’t worth the squeeze.</p>

        <p>This movie has aged great! By focusing on the insular island culture and minimizing intrusion from the outside, it created an environment frozen in time that focuses on people and interactions, and doesn’t suffer from the “this would be done already if we had cell phones” problem.</p>

        <p>If it didn’t invent all the folk-horror tropes, it certainly solidified them. Christopher Lee is fantastic, and in fact, he has said on several occasions that it was his favorite role. Midsommar owes so, so much to this movie. It’s a tighter, higher-production-value movie, but The Wicker Man’s simpler, more earnest style is a better fit for the “folk” part of “folk-horror”.</p>

        <p>I adored the parodical food-porn glamour shots of each dish and the heavy-handed criticism of haute cuisine and the culture around it, in particular, Ralph Fiennes browbeating the insufferable “foodie” into killing himself from shame. Crazy. Head waiter Elsa was also excellently written and acted.</p>

        <p>Like Cabin in the Woods, I judged this book by its cover and the first half was kind of a slog.

        <p>I assume in Japanese the name is a little less clunky. Do they have a single-syllable word for “one cut” so the name’s cadence is closer to Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead or whatever?</p>

It’s hard to find a good horror movie that doesn’t bother with even <em>suggesting</em> supernatural/religious/psychotic tropery, but these are the ones that truly make you uncomfortable due to their potential to actually maybe really happen.</p>

        <p>I’m generally not a fan of body horror, but I thought they hit the mark with enough to contribute to the feeling the movie was going for without accidentally turning the room they were locked inside into Saw Lite.</p>

        <p>This movie is so pretty, and some of the visual elements would steal the show all by themselves in any other movie. (I’m thinking here of the dangling metal mask that J Lo wears.) The plot is not terribly original, but it is (and should be) considered an entirely visual experience. And it’s worth it for that alone.</p>

        <p>I didn’t like this movie when I first watched it. It felt corny, forced, too far outside the realm of believability but without the rest of the trappings (and benefits) of a more out-there plot.</p>

        <p>But after thinking on it for some time, it’s grown on me, specifically <em>because</em> it’s such an out-there core concept in such mundane trappings. What a strange choice for a representation of… STDs? Sexual assault? Death? It’s chilling how such an innocuous action – literally, following – taken to an extreme becomes so unsettling. Plus, I thought that the characters acted pretty reasonably given the insanity they were subjected to.</p>

        <p>This is what would happen if Hemingway wrote a horror movie. In retrospect I <em>kind of</em> like it, but not because it’s likeable on its face so much as that it’s such a brazenly weird and unapologetic vision of… something. It doesn’t even matter what, it’s just the way that it carries itself. Really, it’s more of an… <em>experience</em>… than a story, but that’s not enough to actually recommend anyone else watch it.</p>

        <p>I was convinced that this movie was about mental illness right up until the very end, but the real explanation is much more fun. (Ari Aster confirmed in an interview that there is no trick. It’s what it says it is.) Just a perfectly balanced movie: freaky but believable people; unsettling but not outright hostile to the audience; a great reveal but not one that feels like a gotcha… And that decapitation scene: the perfect choice. We’ve all thought about it when we stick our hands out the car window.</p>

I loved the idea that the alternate universes varied wildly from “nobody left the house and has any idea that anything is amiss” to “murder body doubles”. Plus, blackouts are (usually) fun.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: the movie was filmed in a few days in the filmmaker’s house, and he only gave each actor their own parts and only the parts they needed for <em>that day</em> of filming. So they’re as surprised as you are.</p>

        <p>I love the self-imposed challenge of making a horror movie in broad daylight. I think folk horror, or at least, this strain of it, is all about the pacing, and Midsommar absolutely nails the pacing. You can’t come on too quickly, otherwise you’d scare off the characters/audience who are largely pretty reasonable. Midsommar takes its time, but it never stops: the ramp-up is relentlessly steady; every scene just a little more weird than the last until you realize you’re way past your comfort zone and how did we get here?</p>

        <p>What a mind fuck. This is Aronofsky at his finest. The thing that stuck out the most to me was the visual metaphors for euphoria, paranoia and hallucinations. The editing and camerawork for those did an excellent job conveying a <em>feeling</em> that put you in the character’s shoes.</p>

        <p>The parallel storylines showing four different versions of the same idea, and four different ways they can all go horribly wrong (and worse when they play off of each other), weave together into a surprisingly coherent storyline. At least, as coherent as it can be through the drug haze. I didn’t even find the moral of the story too blunt: we all know where this leads, and the movie did all showing and no telling.</p>

        <p>Full disclosure: I was told, and went in expecting, that this was a horror movie. It’s not. It starts out sort of like one, but once they figure out it’s a UFO-alien, it becomes almost like a heist movie where you spend the first two thirds of the movie gathering the team and the equipment and the last third of the movie executing the heist. Which is fine, and kind of an interesting idea when mashed up like this, but I would rather they just did that from the start and made a different movie instead.</p>

        <p>There were some clever storywriting bits in the “heist” section of the movie, for sure, but the rules felt a little arbitrary and the I-guess-horror-related shots of the inside of the UFO-alien felt more gratuitous and irrelevant to the story than anything else.</p>

        <p>You know how you have that band where you love the first album, and you wish they would just do the same thing again? Some bands do, and it turns out that that’s usually just boring. Some bands go the complete opposite direction and lose the plot. But some bands strike that perfect balance. Those are the best.</p>

        <p>Us is like Jordan Peele’s perfect second follow up album to his #1 charting Get Out. It has a very similar feel but otherwise bears no relation. It’s got quite a bit of worldbuilding, and the fantastical bent of it permits the more overtly weird aspects – like the scissors, or the raspy voices – to blend and contribute rather than stick out as awkward. I really liked the raspy voices in particular: how creepy, that you talk so little that you aren’t even sure how to do it properly anymore.</p>

<h3 id="racking-and-the-break">Racking and the Break</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Rack with the 1 ball at the apex, the 8 ball in the middle, one solid and one stripe in each of the other corners, and the rest randomly. The 1 is placed on the foot spot. [3.2]</li>
  <li>Lag to determine order of play. Winner chooses to break or have opponent break. [1.2] [3.1]</li>
  <li>Table remains open even if a ball is pocketed. [3.3]</li>
  <li>Fouls on the break are opponent’s choice: [3.3]
    <ul>
      <li>Accept the balls in position.</li>
      <li>Ball-in-hand, behind the head string.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="play-and-winning">Play and Winning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The intended ball and pocket must be called if they are not obvious. [1.6] [3.6]</li>
  <li>The shooter continues as long as they pocket shots as called and do not foul. Pocketing additional balls is not a foul and does not end the turn. [3.5]</li>
  <li>The shooter may call “safety”, in which case the turn changes even if they pocket a ball legally. [8.17] [3.6]</li>
  <li>Fouling while pocketing the 8 ball is a loss. [3.8]</li>
  <li>Fouling on an 8 ball attempt without pocketing the 8 ball is treated as a normal foul. (My clarification; implied but not stated explicitly in the rules.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fouls">Fouls</h3>

<p>All fouls are ball in hand without restriction, except as noted during the break.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scratch (pocketed cue). [6.1]</li>
  <li>Wrong first ball. [6.2]</li>
  <li>No contact. [6.3]</li>
  <li>No rail after contact. [6.3]</li>
  <li>Bad play from behind the head string. [6.11]</li>
  <li>Jump shots by “scooping”. [8.16]</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat a non-stick or well-seasoned griddle or small pan to medium-low. Pancakes are very sensitive to uneven heating, so use multiple small pans instead of one large one if you need more space. (This will allow centering the pancakes over the burners.) Pancakes are more like baking than cooking, so having an evenly heated surface ready to go will make it much easier to dial in the temperature as you cook. Don’t butter or oil the pan, as this will cause the pancakes end up splotchy.</p>

<p>In a large bowl, mix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 cup flour</li>
  <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>½ tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
</ul>

<p>In a small bowl, mix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ones and combine throughly. Add:</p>

<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
</ul>

<p>until you have a smooth, thick and just-barely-evenly-pourable batter. When in doubt, err on the side of thicker: you can always add more milk.</p>

<p>To make a pancake, put about ¼ cup batter into the center of the pan. (The batter is thick, so you can use a ⅓ cup measure to pour quickly without having to scrape down the sides.)</p>

<p>Cook a couple minutes, checking the bottom with a spatula and flipping when it’s an even, deep golden brown. The top should be bubbling lightly, but without the bubbles bursting.</p>

<p>Cook until the other side has golden brown patches. (This side will be unavoidably splotchy.)</p>

<p>Serve face up.</p>

Compare the predecessor<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">Nixie tube</a>, which is also cool for different reasons, but needs 10 elements to display all 10 digits. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen-segment_display">14-segment displays</a> can do all 26 letters and 10 numbers.)</p>

<p>Unlike with a Nixie tube, numbers have to be hammered into slightly awkward shapes to fit into a 7-segment display. But we can turn this constraint on its head to find something new! By enumerating all the alphanumeric-like shapes that aren’t already claimed, we might be able to make up some new alphanumeric shapes that feel familiar, but aren’t.</p>

<p>As an aside, something interesting I notice is that my brain is really good at reinterpreting the “backwards” or “broken” shapes: for instance, it really wants to read <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="fegb" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> as 4 and <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="abcge" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> as A.</p>

<p>Anyway, here is me riffing on the 7-segment shapes to see what more-natural shapes come out in handwriting.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/seven-segment/handwritten.jpg" alt="handwritten" /></p>

<p>I was surprised to find that many of these shapes, written at speed, are near indifferentiable from existing characters (e.g. <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="abge" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> as question mark) or even multiple distinct characters (e.g. <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="fgcd" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> as either uppercase S or lowercase b). There’s also now-obvious Greek/Cyrillic ones that I didn’t eliminate up front: <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="efgb" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="afe" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="abcge" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="efabc" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> are, respectively, μ Γ λ Π.

<p>Cut</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 tbsp cold butter</li>
</ul>

<p>into 1/8” cubes and put them in the freezer for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Prepare some ice water. In a food processor, combine</p>

<ul>
  <li>200g all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>½ tsp salt</li>
</ul>

<p>then add the butter chunks and sprinkle in</p>

<ul>
  <li>¼ cup ice-cold water</li>
</ul>

<p>Pulse several times for ~15 seconds until it resembles a coarse meal. Add up to 4 tbsp more cold water if that doesn’t happen. (I like to look for when, after stopping a pulse, the coarse meal sticks together into just a few ½”-sized loose chunks and falls off the side into the middle.)</p>

<p>Pour the mixture onto a cutting board/counter and quickly compress it into a ball with your hands. Wrap it in plastic, then flatten it into an even disk.</p>

<p>Refrigerate at least 2 hours.</p>

The process is tedious, it’s difficult to understand how well it’s working, and I sometimes wonder if it’s worth it, since credit bureaus and insurance companies are basically handing out your PII to hackers.</p>

<p>I persist because it buys me peace of mind and because I’m too principled to concede the point. I try to be somewhat pragmatic about it, and there are instances where I trade privacy for convenience. This makes Google a particularly thorny case, since I value the services they provide – unlike Facebook, which I left years ago and often forget still exists.</p>

<p>This post outlines my de-Googling strategy.</p>

<h2 id="search--kagi">Search → <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a></h2>

<p>Yes: I pay for my search engine. It turns out that if you drink zero cups of coffee a day, the “cheaper than a cup of coffee” marketing play works. In fact… it works better? I have a larger budget for coffee-priced things.</p>

<p>For a long time I used <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> (and I still use it when I’m on someone else’s computer or I can’t be bothered to set up my Kagi account on a device), but I found the quality of the search results barely better than Google, which itself has undergone a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+search+results+are+getting+worse">well-documented decline</a>. Perhaps this is because they’re both advertising-driven, so their incentives aren’t totally aligned with their users.</p>

<p>Kagi, being a pay-for service, only makes money if it serves users’ needs. Imagine that! They churn out features like crazy, including a <em>lot</em> to customize your search results, as well as a bunch of random other services I couldn’t really care less about. It’s really lovely to be able to uprank/downrank sites.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Admittedly, the vast majority of my searches are pretty simplistic,<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> usually ending on Wikipedia, StackOverflow, IMDb… so the bar isn’t terribly high. I occasionally dip back into Google with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!g</code> (<a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html">bangs</a> are a feature they totally stole from DuckDuckGo), but 100% of the time I find the same bad results, so I should really stop bothering.</p>

<h2 id="chrome--firefox">Chrome → <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a></h2>

<p>It’s the same. You’ll be fine, trust me. Using Firefox is like driving a Saab – a <em>perfectly suitable tool</em> for your needs, but because it died out and nobody sees it anymore, you get looks and people assume you’re weird and/or totally out of touch.</p>

<p>I switched to Chrome like everybody else back in the 2010s when it was the hot new thing and Firefox was dog slow, but even though Firefox itself hasn’t <em>quite</em> kept pace (though <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/">the big change in 2017</a> really made a huge difference), computers and connections have gotten faster so it’s not noticeable in real life. What is noticeable is Chrome sucking up all my memory and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome/">normalizing stalker-ish behavior</a> (which they later <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/product-updates-based-your-feedback/">backpedaled on</a>, sort of).</p>

<h2 id="gmail--fastmail">Gmail → <a href="https://fastmail.com">Fastmail</a></h2>

<p>This was the big one. I spent months hemming and hawing on whether I wanted to uproot my entire online identity and replace it with another one. I finally did sometime in 2020, and it’s been… uneventful. The world did not come crumbling down around me, though I’m still in the process of shifting accounts over to the new address. The old account will necessarily have to live forever – it’s in too many places, some of which don’t allow me to change it.</p>

<p>The biggest uncertainty was Fastmail’s quality of spam filtering. Five years later, I can say: perfectly fine. I can recall two incidents where things I needed were erroneously flagged as spam, and one where spam made it to my inbox.</p>

<p>A component of my strategy here involves heavy usage of the masked email addresses. Only real people and important services (or those with KYC protocols, like banks and airlines) get a real email address. This is annoying to enforce and admittedly has not really yielded many benefits, but I’ll keep doing it for peace of mind. I am legitimately surprised at how few companies seem to actually sell my masked email addresses to spammers.</p>

<p>I decided against <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a> because I’m willing to trade off a lack of end-to-end encryption for the convenience of being able to use any client I want anywhere and have it just work. That is, after all, the magic of federated protocols!</p>

<h2 id="maps--apple-maps">Maps → <a href="https://maps.apple.com/">Apple Maps</a></h2>

<p>(With apologies to non-Mac, non-iPhone users.)</p>

<p>Apple Maps used to suck. Like, really bad. It’s improved dramatically in the years since its release, and the only things I ever return to Google Maps for are to check suspicious-looking opening hours, which are <em>occasionally</em> wrong in Apple Maps.</p>

<p>This particular transition has been so successful that whenever I do end up in Google Maps, I find it an overwhelming and unpleasant place to be. The interface is laggy, packed with ads, and bombards you with buttons and completely useless location pins apparently pulled out of a hat. Why??<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Apple Maps is refreshingly direct and crisp, and really only shows you information you ask for.</p>

<p>That said: the search, um, leaves something to be desired. Thankfully, like with Kagi, my search needs are pretty basic – find things by their name, or just the word “gas” – so it gets the job done. Also, I don’t use any of the Yelp-like or custom map/pin features of Google Maps, of which Apple Maps doesn’t have a lot. I use Yelp.</p>

<h2 id="youtube--nebula-max-infuse-and-youtube">YouTube → <a href="https://watchnebula.com/">Nebula</a>, <a href="https://www.max.com/">Max</a>, <a href="https://firecore.com/">Infuse</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a></h2>

<p>Okay, this one is basically impossible to get rid of. It so happens that I subscribe to a lot of channels that are also on Nebula, which I gladly pay $3/month for. I only ever watch YouTube on an Apple TV, so I gave it its own Google account to keep it away from the remains of my real one.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Thankfully, since YouTube is just glorified television, the privacy risk seems minimal. To me, it’s more important to be able to pay to get rid of the ads <em>and</em> have that pay go towards (usually) higher-quality content instead of all the clickbait garbage on YouTube.</p>

<h2 id="drive-docs-sheets--icloud-drive-apple-pages-apple-numbers">Drive, Docs, Sheets… → <a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/">iCloud Drive</a>, Apple Pages, Apple Numbers…</h2>

<p>(With more apologies to non-Mac, non-iPhone users.)</p>

<p>I barely use any of these, so this was an easy transition to make.</p>

<p>I have one primary computer, with backups, so I don’t see much upside to keeping things on Drive. As a programmer, I use my text editor for almost all text-based work, writing maybe one “document” a year. Spreadsheets are usually one-off a couple times a year, so Numbers’ mediocre (but much prettier!) reimplementation of Excel is perfectly serviceable.</p>

<p>I recently started using iCloud Drive for a bunch of shared documents, which was an option available to me, but I only chose it over <a href="https://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> because Dropbox seems like a dying company and the product is really pretty ugly and clunky now.</p>

<h2 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The Elephant in the Room</h2>

<p>Yeah, a lot of what I did was to swap one big tech company for another.</p>

<p>This is a conscious decision I made as part of the convenience/privacy tradeoff. I’m unsure how honest I think Apple’s apparent commitment to privacy is (though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%E2%80%93FBI_encryption_dispute">San Bernadino shooter incident</a> was definitely some good press for them), but since they make money off of hardware and being a services middleman, instead of advertising, it’s much more believeable than the company that <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/google-motto-dont-be-evil/">retracted “don’t be evil” as an unofficial slogan</a>.</p>

<p>With each passing year, the gap between competitors for the commoditized digital products that make up almost this entire list – here meaning primarily Apple, but also sometimes-crappy open source alternatives – closes. If I need to jump ship to OpenStreetMap, I won’t be entirely happy, but it’ll be a lot more usable than it was five years ago.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-do-it-too">You can do it too!</h2>

<p>We’re so conditioned to associate digital convenience and safety with the big names, but that’s an illusion born, I suspect, from sheer ubiquity instead of any unique technical merit. I also think we’re too quick to dismiss something that’s 95% as good as the incumbent because one naturally wants <em>the best</em>. Do you actually use that last 5%? It is worth shipping all your data to Google so that you avoid being misled one time a year about opening hours?</p>

<p>It feels liberating to take back some control over this stuff. For my data to (largely) be my own, insulated from the risk of my online life being smashed underfoot as Google lumbers around locking accounts without recourse because you did one thing that makes you look like a statistical outlier.</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Yorkers are assholes.</li>
  <li>Anyone, put behind the wheel of a car, becomes a monster.</li>
</ul>

<p>The unholy combination of these things yields some of the most <em>effortful</em> douchebaggery you’ll find anywhere in the world. Take, for instance, my Halloween 2022: literally hundreds of children and their parents milling around combined with a partial street closure created some bad traffic on the block, which some jackass in a minivan decided to keep everyone within earshot informed about by leaning on his horn for ten straight minutes uninterrupted. Un. <em>In.</em> <strong><em>Terr.</em></strong> <strong><em>UPTED.</em></strong> TENFULLMINUTES.</p>

<p>While unnecessarily excessive honking is one of the more archetypical New York examples, the city provides triggers for any pet peeve imaginable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standing in doorways</li>
  <li>blocking the sidewalk</li>
  <li>blasting music</li>
  <li>blindingly bright signage</li>
  <li>4 AM yelling</li>
  <li>bad parking jobs</li>
  <li>name-calling</li>
  <li>walking too slowly</li>
  <li>entering while people are exiting</li>
  <li>cutting lines</li>
  <li>video advertisements</li>
  <li>manspreading</li>
  <li>not holding doors</li>
</ul>

<p>…you get the point. If it’s obnoxious and in public, New York has it in spades.</p>

<p>Moving along from the venting, I present you another true fact:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias">Negative events are remembered and internalized better than positive ones.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is some kind of reptile-brain survival instinct we’re stuck with. What it means is that the only way to tolerate life in New York is to at least become inured to it – “it” being New York and everything in it, to be clear, in case you’re still uncertain of my stance on this matter. Most likely, you’ll participate passively since some amount of assholery just inadvertently happens in the course of trying to get where you’re going. For a chosen few, like our minivan driver, you’ll make it a point to participate actively.</p>

<p>It does not take many people doing this, passive or active, to make life miserable in what I call the</p>

<p><em><strong>~ ~ ~ Blast Radius of Inconsideracy ~ ~ ~</strong></em></p>

<p>(Hey, it’s the title of the post!)</p>

<p>For an explanatory example, I return to honking (for which <a href="/honking">I have already developed a solution</a>, by the way, and you’re welcome): if someone cuts you off, you become angry. If you honk at them, you reflect some of that anger back at them, which is fine, but also at everyone within earshot. Venting does help, but not much, so all-in it’s actually <em>you</em> that has contributed far more shittiness to the environment than the person who cut you off. Congratulations, you’re the villain now. It escalates from there.</p>

<p>These interactions happen everywhere. What’s unique about New York in my experience is the frequency of them observed by any one person. If you saw the correct half of Barbenheimer, you may have learned a thing or two about self-sustaining nuclear reactions: it’s not enough to have high-energy matter flying about, you also need enough matter crammed into a small enough space that collisions are frequent enough to keep the whole thing going, and in fact, you can start such a self-sustaining reaction simply by piling enough matter in one place <em>without</em> any explicit ignition.</p>

<p>I think you get the analogy,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I want to put a finer point on that last part: the culture of the schmuck emerges not necessarily from something inherent about New Yorkers, even ones who voluntarily move or stay there presumably knowing what they’re signing up for, but from both the sheer quantity of people and their density, compounded over the years. It arises from the blast radius of inconsideracy, from inevitable negative interactions that irradiate everyone nearby with their negativity. It’s not good.</p>

<p>And that’s it, really. I don’t have any bright ideas on how to improve it. Do you?</p>

Or rather, it took several years of me trying out different bar trivias to find one I really like. When I’m out of town I’ll try out the local trivia, or even when I’m not, I’ll sometimes go see what other bars are putting on near where I live.</p>

<p>And so: I went to one recently that was so un-fun I left part way through. It really helped put into focus what it is about my local place that I like. These are my observations about what makes good bar trivia, in no particular order.</p>

<p>An important disclaimer: while I like winning and I like being right, I also go to trivia to see my friends. Trivia leagues are… fine. Some are done better than others. Many (but not all) of the observations here can apply equally well to casual as well as serious trivia.</p>

<h3 id="score-entire-rounds-at-once">Score entire rounds at once.</h3>

<p>Like a good crossword puzzle, a good trivia round may not be solveable top-to-bottom on the first try. Ask 10 questions, write 10 answers, score 10 answers. Scoring every question as you go introduces a lot of time pressure and sucks out a lot of the fun of rooting around in your subconscious for the answer. It feels like an exam, except that even exams don’t do this.</p>

<p>Scoring-as-you-go also eliminates the possibility of being able to figure out a round’s theme (if present), and then go back and cross-check your answers against the theme. This makes theme rounds more of a chore and less of a reward.</p>

<h3 id="ask-locally-relevant-versions-of-questions">Ask locally-relevant versions of questions.</h3>

<p>I was once asked a question about something that had happened to Steph Curry a week or so before. I had no idea what it was because I don’t follow basketball, but it was definitely my fault because I was in San Francisco.</p>

<p>At the un-fun trivia, I was asked a question about who took Brett Favre’s place in a game in 2007. Not only was that 17 years out of date, but it was for a team thousands of miles away. I didn’t consider the fact that I got it wrong my fault, even though every football fan considers it obvious.</p>

<p>The distinction I’m trying to make here is that the Steph Curry question isn’t purely a sports question. It’s also asking “do you pay attention to things that are important to people around you, even if they aren’t important to you?” The Brett Favre question, by contrast, is a curt “do you watch football?”. The former is both much more engaging in its flavor and delivery, and gives a glimmer of hope to those who aren’t basketball fans.</p>

<p>(Yes, I understand these are different sports, but in trivia, all sports are generally considered to be a single category together. Kind of like all history is one category.)</p>

<h3 id="provide-context-instead-of-just-stating-the-question-outright">Provide context instead of just stating the question outright.</h3>

<p>Given an answer, there are are million versions of a trivia question that can get there. So instead of choosing something short and dry – “Who played the title role in the 1992 movie Bram Stoker’s Dracula?” – give people who aren’t simply encyclopedias something to latch onto to feel like they have a fighting chance of deducing the answer indirectly: “Born in 1958, which English actor often described as a chameleon played the title role in the 1992 movie Bram Stoker’s Dracula?”</p>

<p>(That would be Gary Oldman, by the way. My go-to example of a chameleon of an actor.)</p>

<h3 id="use-paper-not-a-phone">Use paper, not a phone.</h3>

<p>I’m here to hang out at a bar and participate in a group activity. Don’t make me look at my own phone, which is part of what I’m trying to avoid by being out of the house and around other people. If I can do it on my phone, why am I even here? Let’s just do trivia alone at home.</p>

<p>Less is more, in this case. Plus, scoring paper forces a natural lull, so the trivia isn’t an endless assault of questions where you’re afraid to even leave to go to the bathroom. (You could do that with phone-based trivia too, but it seems like the temptation to accelerate is usually given into.)</p>

<h3 id="dont-make-the-spelling-count">Don’t make the spelling count.</h3>

<p>It’s trivia, not a spelling bee. What if you know the answer, but have never seen it written down, like some famous person’s unusual name? Penalizing that is not fun, it’s just hostile.</p>

<p>If we’re talking Serious Business trivia, there is an argument to be made that the correct spelling is an easily-drawn, non-controversial line for where the points are awarded and where they are not. To which I say: if a question’s answer’s spelling is not excruciatingly obvious (i.e. common English words) <em>and</em> isn’t well-known enough in its written form such that to know the fact is to know the spelling, it’s a bad question. Not every question with a clear answer can be a trivia question.</p>

<p>Tell me, can you spell that famous pharaoh’s name correctly? What about Jake G. what’s-his-face, the actor from Donnie Darko? Compare, for example, that poetic Greek Z-word we sometimes used for the wind. If you know the answer, surely you know the spelling.</p>

<h3 id="most-rounds-should-have-a-bare-minimum-of-theme">Most rounds should have a bare minimum of theme.</h3>

<p>Trivia that is constantly swinging violently between pop culture, history, geography, science, etc., gets tiring. Everyone is on high alert all the time, and you rob people of the opportunity to get in the groove if the theme is something they know a bit about.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be a strong theme. “Current events” is a fine theme. It means: I read the news relatively recently, and now I should focus on dredging up all the stuff I remember seeing in the last couple weeks. It gives a light sense of focus without excluding most participants.</p>

<p>Note also the “most”. It’s okay to have a general round or two. Put it between stronger theme rounds as a break, or at the beginning as a warmup. The point is to work with the round-based structure of trivia instead of having a wall of undifferentiated questions that are arbitrarily grouped into sets of 8 or 10 or 12 with no rhyme or reason.</p>

<h3 id="mix-up-the-question-formats">Mix up the question formats.</h3>

<p>Continuing on the topic of avoiding an undifferentiated mass of questions: mix up the formats. It doesn’t need to be wild, out-of-the-box multimedia nonsense, I just don’t want an endless recital of facts and figures with question marks at the end.</p>

<p>There are strong examples of this, like music, picture or under/over/true/false rounds, but it only takes a couple questions structured differently within an otherwise themeless round to give it a little spice.</p>

<p>Examples I’ve seen of this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>categorical questions, where multiple things are named and you have to say what kind of thing they are</li>
  <li>questions with multiple answers, of which you get points for each one (and perhaps with a limit, so you don’t <em>have</em> to know all 15 correct answers)</li>
  <li>even the relatively mundane complete-the-quote can interrupt the monotony a bit!</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="no_toc" id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Taken together, one might say that these are a variety of ways to say “trivia is fun when it’s easier”. To some degree, that’s true – it’s less fun to lose, but it’s really anti-fun to lose by a lot or even to feel like you never had a chance.</p>

<p>But anyway, what’s the point of <em>hard</em> trivia? I see only two: to make the winners feel better, and to clearly separate the winners from the losers. To the first point: who cares. To the second point: this can be done in a way that is more flavorful and engaging for the losers, such as by sprinkling only a couple really hard questions in among the regular ones. You don’t need huge margins to separate the winner.</p>

<p>Trivia leagues excepted, bar trivia is for <em>fun</em>. Competitions are fun when they are engaging while they happen and close when they end.</p>

<p>I previously used (and adored) one of <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">these</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/glove80/ergodox.jpg" alt="ErgoDox" /></p>

<p>This post is a review of the Glove80 with frequent comparisons to the ErgoDox, since it was my baseline for years.</p>

<h2 class="no_toc" id="sections">Sections</h2>

</ul>

<h3 id="feel">Feel</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The housing is nicely minimalist, with no chin or forehead.</strong></p>

    <p>I appreciate this type of minimalism. Large expanses of empty housing like on a regular keyboard, or even the thick (vertically) and slightly wider (horizontally) housing on an ErgoDox makes it feel like an ungainly behemoth in comparison. This does have the unintended side effect of making the carrying case feel even more enormous than it already objectively is. (More on that later.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The halves are so light that they don’t dampen vibrations very well.</strong></p>

    <p>This is relative and not terribly noticeable until you switch back to another keyboard that does. It’s a bit like being in a room that echoes slightly and not noticing until you go to a room that dampens echoes properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The low profile keys are quieter and a little mushier than mechnical keyboards with keys that bottom out.</strong></p>

    <p>The keys are <em>way</em> less satisfying to strike than the heavy bottoming-out you get on more standard mechanical keyboards like the ErgoDox. Since they don’t bottom out, using non-clicky switches will make the keyboard almost silent, which is a nice option if you’re into that. If you aren’t, consider using clicky switches if you’re not normally the type to.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The integrated wrist rests are slippery and too small for those with large hands.</strong></p>

    <p>My palms dangle off the near edge of the wrist rests. This would be tolerable, but not great, except that they’re also pretty smooth so I’m constantly aware of my hands’ positioning in order to keep them from slipping off the near edge. I actually use the huge rubber brick wrist rests that came with the ErgoDox, which I love, and have disconnected the integrated rests. It’s a shame, because having exactly two pieces in total to wrangle would be really nice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="build-quality">Build Quality</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The housing design is prone to damage and seems to be made of relatively soft plastic.</strong></p>

    <p>I accidentally dropped one half a couple inches onto the desk and now there are permanently dulled corners with obvious damage. I don’t know why they didn’t bevel it like the ErgoDox to avoid this kind of damage. Pieces of the case aren’t completely flush with one another, though that’s only on the bottom where it’s usually out of sight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The low profile switches and keycaps rattle slightly when you move the keyboard around.</strong></p>

    <p>The rattling only happens when moving it around, not when typing, but every time I pick it up to pack it it reminds me that it feels a little cheap. The ErgoDox does not rattle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The carrying case that it comes with is very nice, if bulky.</strong></p>

    <p>The two halves fit very snugly into their molded holders and there’s a little room to spare for replacement parts and the relevant tools (like the keycap puller). I would not trust the keyboard to survive unprotected in a backpack or duffel, so the case is a welcome addition. On the other hand, the ErgoDox is indestructible and is therefore in some ways easier to travel with, despite all the associated bits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The switches (and PCB?) are easily broken when replacing keycaps.</strong></p>

    <p>I broke one within a week by pulling out the keycaps too hard (which, to be fair, they warn you about). The keycaps <em>really</em> grip the switches and can jostle the switches around when being replaced, and unlike the ErgoDox the switches aren’t hot-swappable. It was a two-week affair to buy replacements and get a friend to solder it on, but it broke again within a month (PCB damage?) so I just stopped using that location. I broke a couple switches on my ErgoDox but never had to change my keymap to compensate since they could be hot-swapped.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The concavity takes a while to get used to, but makes <em>so many keys</em> available.</strong></p>

    <p>This is the first concave keyboard I’ve owned. It wasn’t difficult to get passably efficient, but it took a couple months before I stopped hitting adjacent keys by accident because they were closer than I was used to. In exchange, every finger gets comfortable access to 5 keys (doubled, for the index/pinky, them being on the edge) compared to the 3-4 on the ErgoDox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The per-finger curvature and offset is <em>excellent</em>, excepting the pinky which should be more curved.</strong></p>

    <p>For the index/middle/ring fingers, all keys feel equally reachable without any preference for the middle finger (it being longer). The pinky is alright, but the second-from-top row is a stretch for it. I would have preferred they curve the pinky column more aggressively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The thumb clusters give only three keys for regular use, but the other three are still comfortable to reach.</strong></p>

    <p>The lower row of thumb keys seems to be intended as the primary one. The upper row requires a small shift of your whole hand to strike fully, though you can graze the innermost upper row key without doing that. The top row is still useful, just for less-frequent keys. The three primary keys are as comfortable as those on the ErgoDox.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>One fewer column on the inner edge is not a problem.</strong></p>

    <p>I liked the big 1.5u keys on the inner columns of the ErgoDox because I could lift my hand and slap them with minimal precision. They were useful for symmetric, rare keys like brackets. The Glove80 takes this away, but since many more keys are reachable with the concavity, you can just bind those keys to the bottommost row, which is the most awkward but still way more reachable than those inner columns were.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The top row is only useful for rarely-used keys.</strong></p>

    <p>It’s too far, except for maybe the middle finger. That’s probably why it defaults to function keys.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="convenience">Convenience</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The wireless inter-keyboard connection is flawless.</strong></p>

    <p>In three months of using the keyboard every day, I have only had the two halves unable to communicate with each other once when I made a mistake while flashing firmware. It just works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Having four Bluetooth connections makes it easy to use my keyboard everywhere.</strong></p>

    <p>I have three computers that I use this keyboard with regularly, so having a dedicated connection for each I can switch between with a single keystroke allows me to use my preferred keyboard with a minimum of fuss. The four-color status indicators are a nice bonus too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Battery life is good but not incredible.</strong></p>

    <p>I’m used to a wired keyboard, so having any battery life to worry about at all is a downgrade. The battery life is measured in weeks, which is long enough to not be a problem but feels short compared to e.g. my mouse, whose battery life is measured in months. I would have preferred a heavier keyboard for unrelated reasons, so adding that weight with a larger battery would have been a win-win in my mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>USB-C yes please.</strong></p>

    <p>No proprietary USB A Logitech dongles, no ErgoDox USB mini-B nonsense (that’s right: <em>not</em> micro-B; do you even remember mini-B?). Everything in my life must be USB-C.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ZMK firmware is a big step up from QMK, even though it’s missing features.</strong></p>

    <p>ZMK was significantly easier for me to pick up and run with than QMK. In particular, it’s much more composable, with a strong macro system that allows combining a library of “behaviors” in infinite ways. Unfortunately ZMK does not have useful mouse key support, so I had to fork it to pull in some unstable code from other people and pile on my own kinda hacky implementations to match the QMK behaviors that I like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The extra Windows/Linux/Mac/”nerd” keycap sets are a nice touch.</strong></p>

    <p>The manufacturer sells keycaps with the Mac command symbol, Tux the penguin, Vim-style HJKL, etc. As you can see in the picture at the top, I currently use a mish-mash of symbols from different places, which I like. I don’t know how hard it is to find custom keycaps that fit these switches, though the switches themselves seem to be a little hard to find.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The switches are soldered, so make the right choice the first time.</strong></p>

    <p>I think I would have preferred clicky switches, but I can’t change them now with resoldering every single key, which sounds like a recipe for breakage. (Well, more than I already broke it by replacing some keycaps.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The manufacturers are cagey about sharing hardware diagrams despite advertising third-party hardware customizations on the site.</strong></p>

    <p>I wanted to try 3D printing extra-long integrated wrist rests for my large hands, but while I did get a quick response on the manufacturer’s Discord<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> when asking for the necessary measurements to properly line up the screw holes, they clearly did not want to share anything specific nor admit that they didn’t want to share anything specific. It quickly became radio silence.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Glove80 resolves all of the ErgoDox’s issues with bulk, layout and accessories while keeping (or providing slight upgrades to!) most of the ErgoDox’s comfort and customizability features. It’s clearly trying to appeal to both average users and keyboard hackers, which sometimes ends up in tradeoffs favoring the average user, such as portability over big clacky keys. It’s noticeably less robust than the ErgoDox, and may not be as comfortable if you have large hands.</p>

<p>If the Glove80 is under consideration for your first serious ergonomic keyboard, buy it, though note that learning a split, concave and columnar layout without any prior experience takes a while.</p>

<p>If you already have a keyboard collection, this is definitely a worthy addition.</p>

<p>If you’re attracted to mechnical clackfests but want something that won’t give you instant RSI, you might be better of with the ErgoDox or something in that family.</p>

During this review, I was struck by a thought and finally able to articulate why I don’t like Redux:</p>

<p>Redux is a design pattern, not a library.</p>

<p>The core of Redux maps directly onto, and is largely implemented by, language-level features:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>reducers: switch + object spread</li>
  <li>actions: discriminated unions (a language-level feature in TypeScript)</li>
  <li>action creators: object literals/constructors</li>
  <li>middleware: higher-order functions/decorators</li>
  <li>dispatch: function call</li>
  <li>store: just… a plain object</li>
</ul>

<p>Redux-the-library doesn’t actually <em>do</em> anything significant; instead, it merely assigns roles and new names to existing language features. Indeed, when Dan Abramov was still involved in it, one of his frequent selling points was that it was <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367">more of an idea than anything else, and so simple that you could even just implement it yourself</a>…</p>

<p>…which is exactly what you’re supposed to do with a design pattern. Have you ever seen a library for the visitor pattern? No you haven’t, because a design pattern doesn’t have enough meat on the bones to be a library. A design pattern doesn’t save work, abstract away complexity or add expressivity. A design pattern guides you in writing the same amount of code you would have without it, but with fewer traps. That’s Redux-the-library in a nutshell.</p>

<p>It is this misinterpretation of Redux as a library that leads to the overengineered, overabstract boilerplate I associate with the ecosystem of things built upon it. Redux-the-library wraps these expressive language-level constructs into restrictive, supposedly-but-not-really higher-level primitives that other things in the Redux ecosystem attempt to build on. But it doesn’t work: there’s no <em>there</em> there, and most of them (thunks and middlewares and sagas, oh my) also end up being design patterns in disguise, with all the attendant implementation work for their users.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: there is nothing inherently wrong with a library mandating the use of restrictive primitives to interact with it. But this is a cost for using it, and in the case of Redux-the-library, there is no benefit in exchange for this cost, because Redux-the-pattern is too simple for Redux-the-library to offer meaningful expressivity or code savings. I would even say that Redux-the-library is <em>competing</em> with the host language rather than complementing it, replacing usefully context-aware expression of Redux-the-pattern’s ideas with a verbose one-size-fits-all implementation of those ideas.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So much of programming is creating abstractions that operate on higher-level primitives. And while it’s true that by moving your solution one rung higher on the abstraction ladder you can solve a broader swath of related problems, it’s also true that your solution then becomes less expressive and ergonomic in the context from which it was born. This might be okay; finding the correct degree of abstraction is a lot of the art of programming. But if you pursue abstraction for its own sake, you end up writing a programming language inside your programming language or <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/opinion-pieces/bad-carma/">a database schema that can represent any other database schema</a>. The abstraction “collapses”, in a sense, to nothing at all. You end up right where you began, but months later and stuck trying to solve anything other than the original problem in your half-baked non-framework.</p>

      <p>The only core Redux concept missing from this list is selectors, which do not correspond directly to a language-level feature, but “composable memoized pure function implementing a view of a value” is not a novel idea. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Originally this post was just me venting about Redux, but I relegated the remainder of that to this (long) footnote and tried to chop it down a bit. Enjoy an entire bonus post, I guess.</p>

      <p>I suspect a lot of the people involved in the major Redux ecosystem libraries had never heard the phrases “state transition”, “pure function” or “copy on write” before and thought that Redux (both pattern and library) was some kind of generational innovation rather than a textbook example of what those things mean when applied to idiomatic JavaScript. Just another example of web developers rediscovering things that other developers have known for a long time. (n.b. I am also a web developer, I guess.)</p>

      <p>Nobody in the ecosystem seems to notice that the only way to open source any of the abstractions they’ve built in-house is to strip them of all opinions and publish a bunch of wrapper functions or reimplementations of existing language constructs, collectively christened with some new name. After all, you can’t open source <em>your</em> action creators, but you can open source, uh, a function that makes functions that put all their arguments into an object literal.</p>

      <p>The towering momuments to abstraction that inevitably emerge when Redux-the-library is used in nontrivial applications ironically end up being as unpleasant to read and write as what you’d have ended up with if you reached for the first thing that comes to mind <em>without</em> Redux-the-pattern, i.e., a massive, mutable global state singleton. Except: the Redux version is smeared across dozens of files and several libraries. Did you know Dan Abramov <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/dsfio6/comment/f6pmgmj/">never used Redux in any production application</a>? In fact, Dan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/dsfio6/comment/f6p4krr/">really doesn’t like Redux anymore</a>.</p>

      <p>A little tangentially, have you ever seen the types for Redux and Redux-adajacent libraries? I mean, <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/blob/0246f788ef964a6afb5071f5b9a651d48630f3e0/packages/toolkit/src/configureStore.ts#L118-L126">look</a> <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/a128c5ebb30bda6e60d597dc37ab97992f8e0d8d/src/types.ts#L110-L124">at</a> <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/blob/1223a1b0997a6b248ccbac3ba4e2a544a7a676d8/src/createSelectorCreator.ts#L80-L104">these</a>.

It’s a mental health hit-and-run, perpetrated one honk at a time.</p>

<p>Just yesterday I was talking about that utterly ridiculous attempt by BMW to make seat heaters a subscription (which they <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/bmw-relents-on-heated-seat-subscription.html">cancelled</a>, by the way, so don’t worry).</p>

<p>Then it hit me: what if there was a subscription model for honking? Like car insurance, a honking subscription would be compulsory, and in order to have the desired effect, it would be pay-per-use. There’s a ton of variations and angles here.</p>

<p>One Very Important Detail for the plan is the payment method: you could only pay in person with cash or check, perhaps at the local DMV or USPS, and you have to do it once a month. If you’re going to be obnoxious and petty, the system is going to be obnoxious and petty back. As a bonus, this also ensures that rich people can’t pay their way out of being dicks.</p>

<p>I know you have questions. I have answered all of them below.</p>

<h2 id="compulsory-honking-usage-fee-faq">Compulsory Honking Usage Fee FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>How would you keep people from working around the car counting honks?</strong> The same way BMW was going to make sure people paid for seat heaters. I’m sure you could hack around it, but I’ll take a 99% compliance rate any day of the week.</p>

<p><strong>Wouldn’t this end up as a regressive tax on the poor?</strong> I guess technically, but if the goal is to inconvenience people more than make them pay, you can put a really low cap on it. Like $5/month low. We don’t want people’s cars getting repossessed over this.</p>

<p><strong>What if someone didn’t pay?</strong> A fine, proportional to your income, like the way Sweden does speeding tickets. Again, don’t want rich people to pay their way out.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do to prevent people from going hog wild on the horn after they reach the monthly cap?</strong> Unfortunately, nothing. It won’t be worse than now, except when you hear it you know that person is going to have to stand in line at the DMV for hours later this month.</p>

<p><strong>What if you only honk a really tiny amount, like once a month?</strong> Everyone gets some freebies every month, which also protects against inadvertent honking. Like the compliance rate, the goal here is masssive reduction, not total elimination.</p>

<p><strong>Won’t people think twice before using their horn for safety?</strong> What safety? Maybe you get a permit, like a parking permit, for X honks/day if you live near a registered blind curve. (Unexpected side effect: people remove safety features of blind curves to make them eligible for the permit.)</p>

<p><strong>What if someone just leans on the horn for a really long time, so it’s only one count?</strong> You could add a honk count for every, say, 1 full second the horn is held down. With a low monthly cap, the point of the count is to get the gist of the severity. It’s not a thorough audit. They’ll definitely still exhaust their freebies this way.</p>

<p><strong>What about all the bureaucracy this would create?</strong> Maybe the program would pay for itself. It’s not exactly intended to be a for-profit endeavour. Alternately: it wouldn’t be the first time the government pays out to <em>stop</em> people from doing something. And this way, we would get peace and quiet instead of, uh, less corn, or soybeans, or whatever.</p>

Remember how they would mess with your intuition, that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram#Paradoxes">silhouettes they drew seemed to lie</a>?</p>

<p>I’m working on a large refactor that is composed of two similarly-sized and similarly-structured systems. Let’s imagine these systems as two similar tangram tiles.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="71px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 0.707 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,0.707 0.707,0.707 0.707,0" />
  </svg>

  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 1,1 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>You can arrange these in a variety of ways, some more aesthetically appealing or easily described than others.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="150px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1.5 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,1 1.5 0.5" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 1,0 1,1" />
  </svg>
  <svg width="171px" height="100px" viewBox="-0.707 0 1.707 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 -0.707,1 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,1" />
  </svg>
  <svg width="141px" height="121px" viewBox="-0.707 -0.707 1.414 1.207">
    <polygon class="one" points="-0.5,0 0.5,0 0,0.5" />
    <polygon class="two" points="-0.707,0 0.707,0 0,-0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>And so it was that I found myself with a software architecture resembling this configuration…</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 0,0 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>The smaller shape represents the underlying domain-agnostic framework for the whole system. Call it the <span class="one">foundation</span>. The larger one is where all the business rules and domain logic lives. Call it the <span class="two">superstructure</span>.</p>

<p>This shape looks unstable and un-elegant. In this analogy, the <span class="one">foundation</span> sort-of supports the <span class="two">superstructure</span> in that it’s mostly on the bottom, but parts of it end up pretty high up where a “<span class="one">foundation</span>” probably shouldn’t reach. On the other end, the pointy bit that sticks out on the bottom is where the <span class="two">superstructure</span> bypasses the <span class="one">foundation</span> completely, which suggests the <span class="one">foundation</span> isn’t providing what the <span class="two">superstructure</span> needs. Plus, the entire system doesn’t sit flat.</p>

<p>Through years of organic software growth, these two systems had developed into this configuration that was difficult to change without risking even more instability.</p>

<p>I considered a few methods to rearrange the shapes that could resolve the instability and awkwardness.</p>

<p>Trying to shift the <span class="two">superstructure</span> higher up without fundamentally changing its shape, so that the <span class="one">foundation</span> could at least actually serve as the base and the whole thing could sit flat, was a lot of work against gravity (if you’ll permit the mixed metaphors) and still ends up with pointy bits sticking out, just elsewhere.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 0.707,1 0.707,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Moving entire pieces from one side to the other, like this example from earlier, would be a lot of effort for little gain.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="171px" height="100px" viewBox="-0.707 0 1.707 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 -0.707,1 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>I tried to think outside the box a bit: I could shift responsibility from the <span class="two">superstructure</span> to the <span class="one">foundation</span> to make the entire system bottom-heavy again. This would still require moving a lot of mass around, even if it isn’t going very far. And it isn’t even clear if this is a meaningful improvement.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 1,1 1,0" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 0,0.292 0.707,0.292" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>After some more aborted out-of-the-box ideas, I decided the best course of action would be to sand off the pointy bits and deal with the remaining, irregularly-shaped pieces that still got too close to the tops and bottoms where they shouldn’t. At least it would be a rectangle that sits flat.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0.707 0,0 1,0 0.292,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>That rectangle sparked an idea. Consider the silhouette – the view from the outside – of the entire system.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="silhouette" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707 0,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Hey… you can construct that with these pieces instead!</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0,0.707" />
    <polygon class="four" points="0,0.707 0.292,0.707 0,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>This layout is still a little awkward, but the relationship of the silhouette to the parts that make it up is <em>much less surprising</em>! And all we had to do to get here is to redraw the lines between the shapes. All the mass stayed where it was. We have rearchitected the system away from one where everything was just a little bit wrong to one where the <span class="three">core</span> is highly regular and it just has some <span class="four">hacks</span> bolted onto it. (Ah, software in the real world.)</p>

<p>It’s now a lot easier to move the <span class="four">hacks</span> around and change the silhouette, since it has relatively little connection to the <span class="three">core</span>. If we want to make a change to the silhouette for some reason (that is: the system, holistically, as seen from the outside), we can do it with less effort and more flexibility.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="158px" height="71px" viewBox="-0.292 0 1.584 0.707">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0,0.707" />
    <polygon class="four" points="1,0.707 1.292,0.707 1,0.414" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Now it lies flat.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,1 1,1 1,0.292 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="four" points="0.292,0.292 0.707,0.292 0.5,0.094" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Now it lies flat <em>and</em> is symmetrical, so the <span class="four">hacks</span> don’t grate quite as much. The possibilities are endless, and with some effort, we could even restructure the <span class="three">core</span> to elegantly subsume all the mass from the <span class="four">hacks</span> – there isn’t that much of it!</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="106px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.060 0.707">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1.060,0 1.060,0.707 0,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>(Yes: it is ever so slightly wider. Conservation of mass, and all that.)</p>

<p>Let’s rewind a bit. What if we <em>did</em> put in the effort to move the original tiles around without redrawing the lines or moving mass between them?</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="141px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="0.707,0.707 1.414,0 1.414,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0.707,0.707 1.414,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>In a silhouette, that looks like this.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="141px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="silhouette" points="0,0 1.414,0 1.414,0.707 0.707,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>You might be able to see where this is going.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="141px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="five" points="0.707,0 1.414,0 1.414,0.707 0.707,0.707" />
    <polygon class="six" points="0,0 0.707,0 0.707,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>A different architecture! Like the other one, it’s not really a two-layer architecture anymore. The precence of the <span class="five">square</span> is an improvement, since squares have even less variability to consider than rectangles. There’s still a <span class="six">triangle</span> sticking out the side, but it matches the side of the <span class="five">square</span> perfectly: a good abstraction boundary, perhaps? Say: a minimal but fully-expressive API that is used mostly at a high level, but doesn’t prevent consumers from using the low-level parts when necessary. That sounds like a practial design to me.</p>

<p>The refactor isn’t done yet, but at least now I have a plan that is realistic, relatively less effort, and has a long-term path towards something halfway decent. Thanks, tangrams.</p>

<p><strong>In general, I don’t recommend watching trailers for any movies.</strong> If you’re here for my recommendations, try to triangulate if you’ll like it from my one-liners or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_line">log line</a> on IMDb. It’s always more fun to go in without expectations (and without spoilers).</p>

          <p>That this movie is excellently acted and shot was immediately obvious, but it took me a while to get over the narrative. I was not expecting (and don’t generally like) “character pieces”.</p>

            <summary>👍 Season 1</summary>
            <p>I would have liked a little more worldbuilding, but that didn’t stop me from watching 10 episodes in two days! The neo-noir thriller elements blended reasonably well into spacefaring mystery-adventure and the heavy-handed social commentary parts, the latter of which thankfully didn’t overbear into preachiness.</p>

            <p>I didn’t know that Syfy made original shows with this high of a production value. I always thought it was Battlestar Galactica-level camp (n.b. that’s not a Syfy original show).</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>👍 Seasons 2-3</summary>
            <p>I lumped these together because I’m writing this review late and I can’t remember where the line is between these seasons, as they’re very same-y.</p>

            <p>The diverging genres and intersecting plotlines of the first season are gone, replaced by a more traditional sci-fi arc. It’s still mostly good, but the protomolecule is straight-up shameless <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">phlebotinum</a>, which makes it difficult to really emotionally invest in said arc and gets narratively tiresome. The characters don’t develop much, and some of the ones I like best, like Anderson Dawes, just fade away.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>👎 Seasons 4</summary>
            <p>Yikes. I was glad for the sharp change in plot direction, because the Halo-esque planet-sized-machine-to-kill-whatever-killed-this-advanced-alien-race-but-failed is near and dear to my heart, but the writing got bad.</p>

            <p>The season is mostly tensionless filler.</p>

            <p>The election arc? Predictable and empty. Bobby’s criminal arc? Okay, but too drawn-out and riddled with plot holes (there’s no reason she would risk her life for one of these missions!). Medina Station? Fun interpersonal dynamics, but <em>nothing is happening</em>.</p>

            <p>But the worst is the Ilus arc. An exploding island (which I think is okay in this universe!) would not cause a planet-spanning shockwave and tsunami that will travel hundreds of miles overland. This impossible tsunami motivates a useless and circuitous subplot that, after several episodes, finds all the characters more or less where they already were, minus a camp, but still stuck with the cartoon villain heading up RCE. The blindness virus lost all narrative credibility when Amos got it, because there was no way the writers would let him stay blind, and lo: a miracle cure. Speaking of Amos, he’s become monosyllabic comic relief, which was always a risk though they used to give him glimpses of deeper personality. This arc should have picked one major problem and dug into it instead of throwing shit at the wall to see what stuck.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>👎 Season 5</summary>
            <p>The show is creaking under its own weight. Things have to keep getting larger, otherwise, Amazon thinks it won’t be able to keep your attention.</p>

            <p>Marco Inaros has character potential, but like the guy from the previous season, ends up a cartoon villain. There are some interesting bits of sci-fi, like flinging steath-shielded asteroids as a weapon, or Naomi doing an emergency suitless EVA. We learn that the Rocinante crew is much more engaging together than they are apart, even though their interactions while together are getting a little stale. I quickly learn to dread scenes with Filip and either of his parents.</p>

            <p>And no, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keon_Alexander">Marco is not wearing eyeliner</a>, he just looks like that!</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>👎 Season 6</summary>
            <p>In the <em>final season</em>, several new plotlines are opened and are intentionally not pursued. I read this as an attempt to avoid the common problem of a wide-ranging show always somehow ending up artificially neatly tied up with a bow, but instead it feels like they just forgot about the subplots.</p>

            <p>The hardness of the sci-fi begins to soften (resurrection, really?), which is disappointing. A lot happens in the final episode, but it still somehow feels like it drags, and all the plotlines that aren’t forgotten about do end up with a neat bow anyway. Nobody undeserving gets hurt (Filip escaped, really?), because the focus groups wouldn’t like that. Marco dies with a whimper more or less out of nowhere, because the all-too-predictable requirements of the narrative arc require that Naomi be the one to kill him in a uniquely Naomi way (the “entities”, really?).</p>

            <p>The best part of this season was the surprising efficacy with which they handled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas_Anvar#Sexual_misconduct_allegations">Cas Anvar being a creep</a>, namely, by having the characters reminisce about the <em>character</em> Alex without ever showing the actor again.</p>

          <p>A much more violent plot than I remember from watching it the first time. Much funnier if you’ve see The Wicker Man, even though there are few direct references to it. The writing, editing, and general feel is a 100% match for Shaun of the Dead as well, so a good movie to watch if you just want that, but again.</p>

          <p>Robert Downey Jr.’s typical frenetic style defines this movie, in fact, this might be one of the more representative examples of his style. This means that, as narrator, his style defines the feel of the movie, which can get a little tiresome when coupled with the fourth-wall breaking narration. It’s kinda fun but not particularly clever, and a few times I wanted him to cut it out.</p>

          <p>The chemistry between the three main characters is excellent and carries the movie, though the Robert Downey Jr./Val Kilmer interactions are for sure the most entertaining dynamic in the movie.</p>

          <p>This movie was <em>okay</em>. The ensemble-cast-running-around-a-big-house-with-comedic-relief thing has been done better in other movies, and the horror elements are light and very trope-y. Dark-comedy-action-fluff.</p>

          <p>Alex’s change of heart was poorly motivated. It seemed like Grace saying she wouldn’t be with him after, y’know, everything, was enough to flip him completely 180. The only hint that might happen was the private conversation with his mother, but he had no reason to lie to her then (and what, be deep undercover?) so the twist must have been unplanned, as it was presented.</p>

          <p>What was the point of this movie? The main narrative arc – man’s negligence leads to death, gets cursed, eventually yields to curse, curse is lifted – is unrewarding and seems incomplete. The possible explanations (fate? prophecy? witchcraft? gods? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System">heat ray</a>?) are so broad that the movie’s high-brow refusal to acknowledge any one of them is simply obnoxious, and the whole thing ends on a whimper of unexplored consequences.</p>

          <p>The stilted dialogue got old fast since it didn’t seem to serve a worldbuilding purpose a la <a href="#the-lobster-2015">The Lobster</a> and everything otherwise seemed normal. The soundtrack was so overbearing that at certain scenes I was distracted from the story, instead just hoping the music would stop. I suppose the goal was to maximize eerieness, but these superficial approaches clashed more than cohered, and the lack of compelling narrative left them to carry the weight of the movie alone.</p>

          <p>The acting was great though, on its own terms.</p>

          <p>I liked the groundedness of this version of the story (unlike the “most canonical” origin story that involves falling into a vat of chemicals), and will note that the movie both echoes <em>V for Vendetta</em> and more or less foretells the reaction to the shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. I read it as a symbol of the times, since the movie is only a few years old: when a murderous psychopath comes off as sympathetic, things are bad.</p>

          <p>One detail I loved: the detective is reciting his phone number on the answering machine while Joker is  crashing around pulling things out of the fridge, so you can’t hear the part where he would have said “555”. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_(telephone_number)">555 numbers</a> can (and do) spoil immersion.</p>

          <p>Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, but I kept getting distracted because he looked kind of like a blend of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hader">Bill Hader</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Fielding">Noel Fielding</a>.</p>

          <p>I love the idea behind this fan edit, and think it’s (accidentally?) a really excellent comparative analysis that highlights the flaws in the source material.</p>

          <p>I went in expecting it to have a more Kurosawa-ish feel, but episodes I-III are written and edited way too fast to ever let you breathe, and the fan edits on top are also really aggressive to keep the runtime in check. The source material is also exceptionally visually cluttered; some scenes really suffer from the lack of color and contrast to help parse them. This is a failure of the originals, not the edit. Coruscant, for instance, is an undifferentiated mass of grey.</p>

          <p>Supposedly the dubbing doesn’t line up with the original dialog, which is a perfect escape hatch to allow skipping over storytelling inanities like midichlorians. But there’s still attention to detail: easily-recognized Japanese words like “hai” or “okasa” appear in the right places, so it still feels right if you’re used to hearing anime.</p>

          <p>Like Apocalypse Now, this movie is all fun and games at the start (well, graded on a curve, since we’re talking about Hitler or Vietnam) and rather quickly shifts tone about halfway through and becomes a dark commentary. This is a good thing.</p>

          <p>A nice keep-you-guessing movie. It establishes untrustworthiness early so even though you know a twist is definitely coming, it’s still a satisfying reveal. Mark Rylance absolutely carries the whole movie, even though it’s descibed as an ensemble cast. I did think that Francis more or less rising from the dead at the end was pointless. Did we need to be told so bluntly that Leonard was who he said he was?</p>

          <p>I’m still really confused about the setting – I spent the whole movie thinking it was happening in the 30s only to be told by someone at the end it was in 1956.</p>

          <p>I liked that the core narrative gimmick was kind of ill-defined and blended several things – supernatural happenings, time travel, body-switching – because the rules weren’t important and it made for some interesting scenes and unexpected plot turns.</p>

          <p>Very. Strong. The Last of Us. Energy. I like a zombie movie that takes itself seriously.</p>

          <p>This movie had some seriously fresh takes on the genre, as well as some unique scenes. Second-generation zombies as symbiotes adds a whole dimension of competing motivations. I have only ever seen a scene walking through a crowd of zombies in Shaun of the Dead – this is hard to make believable! Melanie was very clever and well-acted.</p>

          <p>The ending was pretty cheesy, though I appreciated the role reversal of lessons-in-a-tiny-box from the beginning of the movie. Still, I would rather have her just released the spores for everyone and been done with it. I also didn’t particularly like the feral children, and they only really became “necessary” to fill out the class at the end.</p>

          <p>Like The Cell, this movie was also heavy on the pretty. It has a much more compelling plot, the foreshadowing for which is, in retrospect, pretty obvious. Still, I like that there was a little flourish at the end with the reveal that the whole thing was about stunt men: admittedly I was too distracted to figure that out ahead of time, and it elevated the whole plot.</p>

          <p>I <em>loved</em> the way this movie worked the girl’s questions into the story. Watching the characters react as Lee Pace adjusts the narrative on the fly was fun and novel, and the transition between his narration and letting the characters speak was very smooth so the interruptions weren’t jarring.</p>

          <p>I love that this movie dumps this ridiculous premise in your lap right at the beginning, and then relentlessly follows through. There is never a break from the strangeness: no characters or worldbuilding are at all recognizable and the plot just keeps pushing. The movie establishes this very early so you aren’t completely blindsided, and the pacing does an execellent job meting out revelations and reactions to keep the strangeness fresh.</p>

          <p>The premise was neat and the cinematography was <em>excellent</em>, but it was largely repetitive, the softcore porn and gore were both way beyond what was necessary to demonstrate the point and the social commentary was so simplistic and heavyhanded that it was like bad satire.</p>

          <p>The long-delayed ending highlighted the flaws: a strong hint at a twist that was immediately rescinded (why were they applauding the monster walking down the hallway?), wildly incongruous 70s-style gore, and a general violation of the established rules of the universe. It would have played <em>much</em> better if they’d cut to black as she was injecting the activator for the second time, then let you speculate.</p>

          <p>All that said, I loved a lot of the shots (in particular the early one at the urinal) and thought it was clever how they made an ASMR horror movie (so you can’t just shut your eyes!) with very, very little dialogue.</p>

          <p>No pulled punches with this ending! The snow-is-melting foreshadowing had me dreading some Hollywood garbage.</p>

          <p>The Brave New World angle is far too heavyhanded to take seriously, which allows one to focus on the absurdity and visuals, like the tunnel fight scene (hi, Oldboy), the sushi scene, the school scene and also the whole rest of the movie.</p>

          <p>Two glaring and unnecessary distractions that could have been avoided: the undead henchman (why?) and the “clairvoyance” (could have just said “good at hearing”). Also, what’s the deal with the fish scene?</p>

          <p>This movie is a <em>little</em> hokey 80s, but otherwise has aged pretty well. The product placememnt, especially of the ESPN TV ad and giant Fujifilm light-up billboard, was a bit too in-your-face (and believeable) and ruined a few shots/scenes.</p>

          <p>I wanted to like this movie based on the premise, but I just couldn’t get over the fact that it was 90 minutes of selfish people acting irrationally. I spent the whole movie being pissed off at how awful and, worse, stupid, everybody was.</p>

          <p>This was like a Black Mirror episode, but without any cleverness or depth to the commentary. Or like The Office, but not really funny. In short: stressful but without a reward. The whole thing ends with a whimper.</p>

          <p>I didn’t appreciate the in-your-face Gen Z social media commentary near the end: yeah, we get that the reference was internet lynch mobs. It served no narrative or explanatory purpose and was just a triggering cheap shot out of left field.</p>

          <p>This movie has all the trappings of yet another mass-manufactured superhero movie, but is constantly missing the mark on why people like those: the dialogue is stilted, the CG is bad, the costumes are off the shelf, the pacing is all over the place, and the characters think they have charisma when they don’t.</p>

          <p>This movie also has all the things that make those superhero movies bad too: they swing violently between shoving exposition down your throat or not bothering to explain anything at all, the universe is obviously created just to make sequels and spinoffs, and the whole thing is absolutely never-ending.</p>

          <p>I can’t resist quoting someone else’s review: “the cinematic equivalent of clickbait”. Spot on.</p>

          <p>The commentary that Hollywood is heartless and exploitative is nothing new, and was done in a more interesting way in the <a href="#joan-is-awful-2023">preceding episode</a> already. The American girl was selfish and oblivious, which I assume was intentional on the writers’ part, but I still quickly came to dread all the scenes she was in.</p>

          <p>I should credit this episode which clarifying to me why I hate true crime as a genre, but I would not recommend watching it just to find that out.</p>

          <p>For an episode that repeats several times how beautiful Scotland is, they really ruined some shots with that gigantic branded rental van sitting there like a billboard. They also mention Netflix by name but bring back Streamberry, which muddles the message and isn’t used nearly as effectively as the previous episode.</p>

          <p>This movie was surprisingly apolitical, in the sense that it didn’t choose a side (left/right) and stuck to merely anti-establishment.</p>

          <p>For the first two thirds of the movie I kept thinking about The Last of Us, which is telling because I think post-apocalyptic movies are only way we see the US looking anything like this. It’s an effective translation of what it means to be war-torn for a country that hasn’t taken it for 150 years, but loves to dish it out.</p>

          <p>The tense moments were sometimes undermined by the poor decision-making that led there (i.e. any time a journalist died). Why didn’t they bring a medical kit in that huge car if they were heading into a warzone?</p>

          <p>The trailers for this movie made it seem like trash, and I only watched it because I saw it was A24. Don’t watch trailers.</p>

It gave me a movie with a Russian “criminal mastermind”, a wise Japanese father figure, a former special ops agent with “a penchant for trouble” and of course Idris Elba as wildcard. Yup, basically nailed it.</p>

          <p>In addition to the regurgitated non-plot there was just too much overdone CGI, too many cutesy/predictable/unoriginal comedic moments, too many cloyingly one-dimensional characters, too many cameos, and way too much brazen product placement.</p>

          <p>This episode was definitely saved by its ending. For the first three quarters I was put off by the obviously-too-obvious Netflix doppelganger, the weird fawning over Salma Hayek and the “quantum computers explain everything” plot justification.</p>

          <p>Then suddenly: <em>I am in this universe</em> because I am watching Streamberry, Salma Hayek is playing herself but as would be written for a TV show, and quantum computers are an acceptable plot device where multiverses are involved. Bam!</p>

          <p>This is cleverly pragmatic storywriting too, because they can pawn off plot holes (i.e., that’s <em>definitely</em> not an enforceable contract) as being part of the worldbuilding from inside the TV episode.</p>

          <p>At first I was complimentary to Netflix for letting such an episode be made, but now I worry that they are so embedded in the culture that they can point out “lol we intentionally make TV to keep you selfish and addicted” and everyone will just laugh it off.</p>

          <p>This movie is to Blade Runner as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight"><em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em></a> is to <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> That is: the characters and many plot elements are shared, but the arc and destination end up quite different (e.g. the addition of St. Winifred; the presumed beheading at the end).</p>

          <p>The feel of the movie is very A24, <a href="#saint-maud-2019">Saint Maud</a>-ish, due to the camerawork, editing and pacing. They like the “atmospheric” thing coupled with mostly-unsubtle visual metaphors/references/hints, with a bit of reading between the lines.</p>

          <p>I watched this lying down on the floor which made a handful of the shots very disorienting indeed – especially the skyward entry through the castle doors. The full-circle shot where he becomes and then un-becomes a skeleton was neat.</p>

          <p>The tension in this episode came from all the wrong places. Usually, Black Mirror episodes crank up the tension either by subjecting the characters to stresses until they break, or giving them time to realize their situation and take action. This episode had all the typical shallow pressures from crappy action movies, up to and including a car chase. It cheapens the plot.</p>

          <p>The “resurrection by technology” idea has been explored in several other Black Mirror episodes to much greater effect.</p>

          <p>I did really like the reveal at the end, where it turned out the pop song was just NIN in disguise. Miley Cyrus even released her version under the name Ashley O!</p>

          <p>The director said he was inspired after watching Inglorious Basterds, which you can really see in the increasing shamelessness and detachment from reality. Very fun, but like Inglorious Basterds, you have to roll with it (which took me about an hour into the movie to do).</p>

          <p>This is the first <del>Bollywood</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_cinema">Tollywood</a> movie I’ve seen in some time, so while I expected the dance numbers, I was was not prepared for the blunt exposition and saturated/airbrushed appearance of the entire movie. The writing and delivery of the British characters was quite poor, but I suppose that’s because nobody gives a damn about what they have to say. I hope the Telugu was better, though some of the translations of the song lyrics were doing a whole lot of telling and not a lot of showing. Also, that friendship montage was incredible: borderline gay romance territory.</p>

          <p>By the way, their appearance at the end of the movie is apparently an explicit reference to their iconography in the culture. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluri_Sitarama_Raju">bow and arrow</a> was not just for show.</p>

          <p>It’s fun. Moviemaking-wise, my favorite aspect was the mirrored plotlines and the four girls being body doubles of sorts (especially since three of the four in the second half were playing stuntwomen). It was a bit slow at times.</p>

          <p>I figure that B movies like this peaked in the 70s, and nothing about the movie definitively identifies it as <em>not</em> being in the 70s save for the clothing… until the cell phone comes out and they mention Lindsey Lohan. That was surprising and an unfortunately unnecessary dating of the movie since both details were irrelevant to the plot, but maybe that’s the point? Do slasher movies date themselves awkwardly like that?</p>

          <p>“Eco-terrorism” has always felt like an extreme label broadly applied to any type of direct action, and I like that a movie like this can be made to explore one possible end state of groups like Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion.</p>

          <p>Yes, it is a bit preachy, but it’s largely believable, with some allowances: Logan’s tire-slashing/gunfire-dodging agility; Rowan’s conning of the FBI; the physics of shutting off an oil pipeline; the economic/social/racial diversity of the small group. It’s also definitely a bit cathartic, which might mean that it contributes to apathy regarding climate change. Think on that.</p>

          <p>I think that this movie can also be considered a translation for us moderns of why, say, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground">Weather Underground</a> emerged: their issues were similarly pressing as climate change is to us now.</p>

          <p>This show leaned <em>really</em> heavily into the “Nazi” part of “space Nazis”, which are less compelling than real Nazis. The Designed in California prison subplot was ultimately zero sum (they were looking for him but didn’t know they had him already, and he escaped and ended up alone anyway) and the Peter-Parker-looking Nazi boy scout didn’t do anything the dominatrix in white couldn’t have done by herself.</p>

          <p>I think this could have been a 3/4-episode miniseries that focused on how Mon Mothma and whoever Stellan Skarsgård is supported the storming of the base and how Andor ended up there. (This show definitely rewards those who kept track of every minor character in the main Star Wars plot lines.)</p>

          <p>I could only make it through four of ten episodes. Even allowing for it being a character piece the pacing is far too slow, and the out-of-order storytelling is so overdone as to give the impression the writers are arbitrarily withholding information to be hostile (as opposed to, say, putting you in the shoes of a lost/confused character).</p>

          <p>In the Before, why is everyone immediately and absolutely convinced it’s the literal apocalypse? I lived through real-life COVID where there was more fearmongering than here, and people didn’t act like that. It ruins the effect. The show should know better, being made in 2021.</p>

          <p>The sets and especially costumes were fantastic, but not enough to bother watching (unlike, say, <a href="#the-cell-2000">The Cell</a>). I also love the concept of a Mad Max-lite travelling troupe.</p>

          <p>This movie had a whole lot of foreshadowing, but almost all of it was quite subtle, like the cheap sunglasses sitting on the side table in the actor’s house, which were very much not the focus of the scene.</p>

          <p>The final shot with the spider was at first scary, and then very quickly absurd. The spider was scared!

          <p>Casting was great; on screen chemistry between the two main actors was good. The story would plod at times, but I kept coming back for the aesthetics and because there were many individually good scenes, even in the slower episodes.</p>

          <p>For a modern show about a violent era, I thought it was relatively restrained in the use of sex and violence, the latter in particular well-used as a sharp accent when the story needed it.</p>

          <p>I didn’t like the first episode all that much but was happy to stick with it. I would have preferred more palace intrigue and less romance. I like a show that inspires me to read up on the history of the thing!</p>

          <p>This was a good night’s entertainment, well acted and really really tense, but I don’t think it’ll stick with me. The story is straightforward; it’s small and messy and ill-conceived; it’s probably closer than any thriller to how such a feud would play out. But it didn’t get under my skin like, say, Green Room did.</p>

          <p>I consider this movie an object lesson in how guns can make mountains out of molehills. (Even though the first murder they showed was a stabbing, the original one, before the movie started, was a shooting too.) And, I suppose, that revenge is fleeting.</p>

          <p>There was a. lot. of sex in this movie, which I suppose makes sense since Bella is effectively a teenager in an adult’s body for much of it. Taken individually, the sex scenes were amusing, but I was disappointed that they didn’t clearly delineate a single era in Bella’s life, like the black and white era, or the first-foray-into-the-real-world era. They blurred the remainder of the movie together. Not what I expected based on the first half hour.</p>

          <p>I saw a great quote from another review of this movie: just because something is anti-sexist, doesn’t mean it’s feminist. Framing empowerment through prostitution seems fraught, and the madame was more than a little exploitative herself.</p>

          <p>The guy who played Harry Astley was so, so flat in his delivery that I very quickly started to dread him ruining the scenes he was in. Was it intentional? Emma Stone though, she was incredible.</p>

          <p>I really like this movie as a dark, foul-mouthed interpretation of what a Wes Anderson movie could be.</p>

          <p>Most of this movie felt like a meditation on how bad sleep deprivation can get. (Or a toothache.) As it accelerated it became a bit like Requiem for a Dream Lite (Ellen Burstyn’s character), complete with drugs, except in this case the hallucinations (?) were not drug-induced but a real (?) monster.</p>

          <p>In any case, the paranoia and uncertainty in the first half or two thirds were for sure the most compelling psychological horror part, but once the monster started showing up for real I lost interest. I don’t know that it would have been any better if it used the “surprise it’s just mental illness” escape hatch, though it set itself up for that. I thought the role reversal between mother and child was amusing. Almost as amusing as the Home Alone contraptions.</p>

          <p>An effect I liked in particular was right after the possession, when the mom is watching TV: the inability to focus and the quick twitches the camera makes are simple but effective.</p>

          <p>The set pieces are absolutely incredible. Lots and lots of horses, yes, but the king wandering out of the burning castle while the armies part to let him pass… yowza. They really built and burned a full-size set for that.</p>

          <p>The first half is a legitimately scary movie, even if the snuff films started to get a bit overdone for little added effect. In particular, I like the way they explained away trope-y, spooky sounds with e.g. night terrors, or the way they demonstrated Ethan Hawke wasn’t simply going crazy because other characters corroborated some apparently-supernatural happenings.</p>

          <p>It would have been a <em>significantly</em> better movie if they had held the supernatural reveal until the box of movies reappears in the attic right before the end. You would have spent 95% of the movie scared about a murderous and superhumanly stealthly and methodical stalker, and then, twist, it actually <em>is</em> supernatural and the children get Ringu’d into the home movies.</p>

          <p>This one is a little less exciting for not-already-Dune-fans, and even already-Dune-fans, because it doesn’t get to introduce all the wild world-building and main characters, like the first one did. It’s still absolutely worth rewatching, though probably as part of a marathon.</p>

          <p>Had I known that the movie did not intend to take itself entirely seriously I would have gone in with different expectations, but I don’t think that would have saved it.

          <p>This movie has aged great! By focusing on the insular island culture and minimizing intrusion from the outside, it created an environment frozen in time that focuses on people and interactions, and doesn’t suffer from the “this would be done already if we had cell phones” problem.</p>

          <p>If it didn’t invent all the folk-horror tropes, it certainly solidified them. Christopher Lee is fantastic, and in fact, he has said on several occasions that it was his favorite role. Midsommar owes so, so much to this movie. It’s a tighter, higher-production-value movie, but The Wicker Man’s simpler, more earnest style is a better fit for the “folk” part of “folk-horror”.</p>

When the reveal came halfway through the movie, it was transformed and it’s now up there with things like Primer as an excellently tight movie doing a lot with very little and really rewarding you for paying attention and sticking with it.</p>

          <p>I assume in Japanese the name is a little less clunky. Do they have a single-syllable word for “one cut” so the name’s cadence is closer to Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead or whatever?</p>

          <p>But really, a murder-y mental breakdown in a mental asylum felt inevitable and was the only reasonable non-supernatural explanation right from the start. You can do without this movie.</p>

The polish is evident and there are a few elements I really liked – using Welsh for speaking in tongues, and especially the visuals in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRU7ni9G3rw">last scene of the film</a> (<strong>warning:</strong> mega spoilers at that link)  – but it’s hard to get invested when the movie is telegraphing fanatical mental illness with all the usual religious iconography.</p>

          <p>Unlike a PDK book or their adaptations, the worldbuilding here is minimal and the show barely bothers to actually explore the consequences of the premise. It designs itself a blank slate, and then excruciatingly slowly paints it with shallow, focus-tested filler. In a word: pointless. Or maybe: disappointing.</p>

          <p>Oooof. This was a rough watch, but in a good way. It’s hard to find a good horror movie that doesn’t bother with even <em>suggesting</em> supernatural/religious/psychotic tropery, but these are the ones that truly make you uncomfortable due to their potential to actually maybe really happen.</p>

          <p>I’m generally not a fan of body horror, but I thought they hit the mark with enough to contribute to the feeling the movie was going for without accidentally turning the room they were locked inside into Saw Lite.</p>

          <p>I didn’t like this movie when I first watched it. It felt corny, forced, too far outside the realm of believability but without the rest of the trappings (and benefits) of a more out-there plot.</p>

          <p>But after thinking on it for some time, it’s grown on me, specifically <em>because</em> it’s such an out-there core concept in such mundane trappings. What a strange choice for a representation of… STDs? Sexual assault? Death? It’s chilling how such an innocuous action – literally, following – taken to an extreme becomes so unsettling. Plus, I thought that the characters acted pretty reasonably given the insanity they were subjected to.</p>

          <p>This is what would happen if Hemingway wrote a horror movie. In retrospect I <em>kind of</em> like it, but not because it’s likeable on its face so much as that it’s such a brazenly weird and unapologetic vision of… something. It doesn’t even matter what, it’s just the way that it carries itself. Really, it’s more of an… <em>experience</em>… than a story, but that’s not enough to actually recommend anyone else watch it.</p>

          <p>It’s a bit of a shame, because I thought that both castings and both performances were excellent.</p>

          <p>I was convinced that this movie was about mental illness right up until the very end, but the real explanation is much more fun. (Ari Aster confirmed in an interview that there is no trick. It’s what it says it is.) Just a perfectly balanced movie: freaky but believable people; unsettling but not outright hostile to the audience; a great reveal but not one that feels like a gotcha… And that decapitation scene: the perfect choice. We’ve all thought about it when we stick our hands out the car window.</p>

          <p>This movie feels like a lovely small-scale mashup of Primer and, I suppose, Clue. Or like game of hidden identity, except fun. Minimal props, minimal sets, minimal effects: just a bunch of people as confused as the audience trying to figure things out. I loved the idea that the alternate universes varied wildly from “nobody left the house and has any idea that anything is amiss” to “murder body doubles”. Plus, blackouts are (usually) fun.</p>

          <p>Fun fact: the movie was filmed in a few days in the filmmaker’s house, and he only gave each actor their own parts and only the parts they needed for <em>that day</em> of filming. So they’re as surprised as you are.</p>

          <p>Ghosts are my least favorite kind of scare. They require a lot of suspension of disbelief but usually offer little storytelling oomph in return, often less than pagan gods, or witches, or zombies, or those sorts of things.</p>

          <p>I did like some elements and characters of this film, especially the older couple running the orphanage. The child actors are not bad, though the makeup on the ghost boy sure is. I wanted to like it more than I did, and it still feels a little harsh to recommend not watching it, but I’d pick most other horror movies on this list first, for sure.</p>

          <p>Yes, a thousand times yes, I adored this movie. The core supernatural concept was deliciously unsettling to the point where I almost regretted watching it alone in the dark. Framing the hand as a party drug was, to my knowledge, a unique approach that allowed to characters to behave like realistically risky, smartphone-wielding teenagers.</p>

          <p>The visual effects struck the perfect balance of creepy without going overboard, and the increasingly-unsubtle audio-visual cues of the possessive underworld woman were a nice touch.</p>

          <p>I love the self-imposed challenge of making a horror movie in broad daylight. I think folk horror, or at least, this strain of it, is all about the pacing, and Midsommar absolutely nails the pacing. You can’t come on too quickly, otherwise you’d scare off the characters/audience who are largely pretty reasonable. Midsommar takes its time, but it never stops: the ramp-up is relentlessly steady; every scene just a little more weird than the last until you realize you’re way past your comfort zone and how did we get here?</p>

          <p>What a mind fuck. This is Aronofsky at his finest. The thing that stuck out the most to me was the visual metaphors for euphoria, paranoia and hallucinations. The editing and camerawork for those did an excellent job conveying a <em>feeling</em> that put you in the character’s shoes.</p>

          <p>The parallel storylines showing four different versions of the same idea, and four different ways they can all go horribly wrong (and worse when they play off of each other), weave together into a surprisingly coherent storyline. At least, as coherent as it can be through the drug haze. I didn’t even find the moral of the story too blunt: we all know where this leads, and the movie did all showing and no telling.</p>

          <p>Full disclosure: I was told, and went in expecting, that this was a horror movie. It’s not. It starts out sort of like one, but once they figure out it’s a UFO-alien, it becomes almost like a heist movie where you spend the first two thirds of the movie gathering the team and the equipment and the last third of the movie executing the heist. Which is fine, and kind of an interesting idea when mashed up like this, but I would rather they just did that from the start and made a different movie instead.</p>

          <p>There were some clever storywriting bits in the “heist” section of the movie, for sure, but the rules felt a little arbitrary and the I-guess-horror-related shots of the inside of the UFO-alien felt more gratuitous and irrelevant to the story than anything else.</p>

          <p>You know how you have that band where you love the first album, and you wish they would just do the same thing again? Some bands do, and it turns out that that’s usually just boring. Some bands go the complete opposite direction and lose the plot. But some bands strike that perfect balance. Those are the best.</p>

          <p>Us is like Jordan Peele’s perfect second follow up album to his #1 charting Get Out. It has a very similar feel but otherwise bears no relation. It’s got quite a bit of worldbuilding, and the fantastical bent of it permits the more overtly weird aspects – like the scissors, or the raspy voices – to blend and contribute rather than stick out as awkward. I really liked the raspy voices in particular: how creepy, that you talk so little that you aren’t even sure how to do it properly anymore.</p>

          <p>I loved that the show stayed true to the game. I wanted to like the game-as-story more than I did, but the uncanny valley was too strong for me. Having it done live action and non-interactively (so the pacing and delivery can be perfected) is definitely what the doctor ordered. The casting is excellent all around.</p>

          <p>This show did everything right that the Walking Dead did wrong. The zombies are scarier and used more effectively and convincingly (instead of treated as necessary nuisance for the setting), and the tight focus on only one complex relationship is far more compelling than a glorified soap opera ensemble cast.</p>

          <p>It is worth watching even if you’ve played the game and didn’t have uncnany valley problems with it, if only to relive the game.</p>

The corresponding full rule’s number is cited in [brackets].</p>

<h3 id="racking-and-the-break">Racking and the Break</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Rack with the 1 ball at the apex, the 8 ball in the middle, one solid and one stripe in each of the other corners, and the rest randomly. The 1 is placed on the foot spot. [3.2]</li>
  <li>Lag to determine order of play. Winner chooses to break or have opponent break. [1.2] [3.1]</li>
  <li>Table remains open even if a ball is pocketed. [3.3]</li>
  <li>Fouls on the break are opponent’s choice: [3.3]
    <ul>
      <li>Accept the balls in position.</li>
      <li>Ball-in-hand, behind the head string.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="play-and-winning">Play and Winning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The intended ball and pocket must be called if they are not obvious. [1.6] [3.6]</li>
  <li>The shooter continues as long as they pocket shots as called and do not foul. Pocketing additional balls is not a foul and does not end the turn. [3.5]</li>
  <li>The shooter may call “safety”, in which case the turn changes even if they pocket a ball legally. [8.17] [3.6]</li>
  <li>Fouling while pocketing the 8 ball is a loss. [3.8]</li>
  <li>Fouling on an 8 ball attempt without pocketing the 8 ball is treated as a normal foul. (My clarification; implied but not stated explicitly in the rules.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fouls">Fouls</h3>

<p>All fouls are ball in hand without restriction, except as noted during the break.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scratch (pocketed cue). [6.1]</li>
  <li>Wrong first ball. [6.2]</li>
  <li>No contact. [6.3]</li>
  <li>No rail after contact. [6.3]</li>
  <li>Bad play from behind the head string. [6.11]</li>
  <li>Jump shots by “scooping”. [8.16]</li>
</ul>

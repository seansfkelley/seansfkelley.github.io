It’s a mental health hit-and-run, perpetrated one honk at a time.</p>

<p>Just yesterday I was talking about that utterly ridiculous attempt by BMW to make seat heaters a subscription (which they <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/bmw-relents-on-heated-seat-subscription.html">cancelled</a>, by the way, so don’t worry).</p>

<p>Then it hit me: what if there was a subscription model for honking? Like car insurance, a honking subscription would be compulsory, and in order to have the desired effect, it would be pay-per-use. There’s a ton of variations and angles here.</p>

<p>One Very Important Detail for the plan is the payment method: you could only pay in person with cash or check, perhaps at the local DMV or USPS, and you have to do it once a month. If you’re going to be obnoxious and petty, the system is going to be obnoxious and petty back. As a bonus, this also ensures that rich people can’t pay their way out of being dicks.</p>

<p>I know you have questions. I have answered all of them below.</p>

<h2 id="compulsory-honking-usage-fee-faq">Compulsory Honking Usage Fee FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>How would you keep people from working around the car counting honks?</strong> The same way BMW was going to make sure people paid for seat heaters. I’m sure you could hack around it, but I’ll take a 99% compliance rate any day of the week.</p>

<p><strong>Wouldn’t this end up as a regressive tax on the poor?</strong> I guess technically, but if the goal is to inconvenience people more than make them pay, you can put a really low cap on it. Like $5/month low. We don’t want people’s cars getting repossessed over this.</p>

<p><strong>What if someone didn’t pay?</strong> A fine, proportional to your income, like the way Sweden does speeding tickets. Again, don’t want rich people to pay their way out.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do to prevent people from going hog wild on the horn after they reach the monthly cap?</strong> Unfortunately, nothing. It won’t be worse than now, except when you hear it you know that person is going to have to stand in line at the DMV for hours later this month.</p>

<p><strong>What if you only honk a really tiny amount, like once a month?</strong> Everyone gets some freebies every month, which also protects against inadvertent honking. Like the compliance rate, the goal here is masssive reduction, not total elimination.</p>

<p><strong>Won’t people think twice before using their horn for safety?</strong> What safety? Maybe you get a permit, like a parking permit, for X honks/day if you live near a registered blind curve. (Unexpected side effect: people remove safety features of blind curves to make them eligible for the permit.)</p>

<p><strong>What if someone just leans on the horn for a really long time, so it’s only one count?</strong> You could add a honk count for every, say, 1 full second the horn is held down. With a low monthly cap, the point of the count is to get the gist of the severity. It’s not a thorough audit. They’ll definitely still exhaust their freebies this way.</p>

<p><strong>What about all the bureaucracy this would create?</strong> Maybe the program would pay for itself. It’s not exactly intended to be a for-profit endeavour. Alternately: it wouldn’t be the first time the government pays out to <em>stop</em> people from doing something. And this way, we would get peace and quiet instead of, uh, less corn, or soybeans, or whatever.</p>

Remember how they would mess with your intuition, that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram#Paradoxes">silhouettes they drew seemed to lie</a>?</p>

<p>I’m working on a large refactor that is composed of two similarly-sized and similarly-structured systems. Let’s imagine these systems as two similar tangram tiles.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="71px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 0.707 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,0.707 0.707,0.707 0.707,0" />
  </svg>

  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 1,1 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>You can arrange these in a variety of ways, some more aesthetically appealing or easily described than others.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="150px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1.5 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,1 1.5 0.5" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 1,0 1,1" />
  </svg>
  <svg width="171px" height="100px" viewBox="-0.707 0 1.707 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 -0.707,1 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,1" />
  </svg>
  <svg width="141px" height="121px" viewBox="-0.707 -0.707 1.414 1.207">
    <polygon class="one" points="-0.5,0 0.5,0 0,0.5" />
    <polygon class="two" points="-0.707,0 0.707,0 0,-0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>And so it was that I found myself with a software architecture resembling this configuration…</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 0,0 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>The smaller shape represents the underlying domain-agnostic framework for the whole system. Call it the <span class="one">foundation</span>. The larger one is where all the business rules and domain logic lives. Call it the <span class="two">superstructure</span>.</p>

<p>This shape looks unstable and un-elegant. In this analogy, the <span class="one">foundation</span> sort-of supports the <span class="two">superstructure</span> in that it’s mostly on the bottom, but parts of it end up pretty high up where a “<span class="one">foundation</span>” probably shouldn’t reach. On the other end, the pointy bit that sticks out on the bottom is where the <span class="two">superstructure</span> bypasses the <span class="one">foundation</span> completely, which suggests the <span class="one">foundation</span> isn’t providing what the <span class="two">superstructure</span> needs. Plus, the entire system doesn’t sit flat.</p>

<p>Through years of organic software growth, these two systems had developed into this configuration that was difficult to change without risking even more instability.</p>

<p>I considered a few methods to rearrange the shapes that could resolve the instability and awkwardness.</p>

<p>Trying to shift the <span class="two">superstructure</span> higher up without fundamentally changing its shape, so that the <span class="one">foundation</span> could at least actually serve as the base and the whole thing could sit flat, was a lot of work against gravity (if you’ll permit the mixed metaphors) and still ends up with pointy bits sticking out, just elsewhere.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 0.707,1 0.707,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Moving entire pieces from one side to the other, like this example from earlier, would be a lot of effort for little gain.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="171px" height="100px" viewBox="-0.707 0 1.707 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 -0.707,1 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>I tried to think outside the box a bit: I could shift responsibility from the <span class="two">superstructure</span> to the <span class="one">foundation</span> to make the entire system bottom-heavy again. This would still require moving a lot of mass around, even if it isn’t going very far. And it isn’t even clear if this is a meaningful improvement.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 1,1 1,0" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 0,0.292 0.707,0.292" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>After some more aborted out-of-the-box ideas, I decided the best course of action would be to sand off the pointy bits and deal with the remaining, irregularly-shaped pieces that still got too close to the tops and bottoms where they shouldn’t. At least it would be a rectangle that sits flat.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0.707 0,0 1,0 0.292,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>That rectangle sparked an idea. Consider the silhouette – the view from the outside – of the entire system.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="silhouette" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707 0,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Hey… you can construct that with these pieces instead!</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0,0.707" />
    <polygon class="four" points="0,0.707 0.292,0.707 0,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>This layout is still a little awkward, but the relationship of the silhouette to the parts that make it up is <em>much less surprising</em>! And all we had to do to get here is to redraw the lines between the shapes. All the mass stayed where it was. We have rearchitected the system away from one where everything was just a little bit wrong to one where the <span class="three">core</span> is highly regular and it just has some <span class="four">hacks</span> bolted onto it. (Ah, software in the real world.)</p>

<p>It’s now a lot easier to move the <span class="four">hacks</span> around and change the silhouette, since it has relatively little connection to the <span class="three">core</span>. If we want to make a change to the silhouette for some reason (that is: the system, holistically, as seen from the outside), we can do it with less effort and more flexibility.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="158px" height="71px" viewBox="-0.292 0 1.584 0.707">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0,0.707" />
    <polygon class="four" points="1,0.707 1.292,0.707 1,0.414" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Now it lies flat.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="100px" height="100px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,1 1,1 1,0.292 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="four" points="0.292,0.292 0.707,0.292 0.5,0.094" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>Now it lies flat <em>and</em> is symmetrical, so the <span class="four">hacks</span> don’t grate quite as much. The possibilities are endless, and with some effort, we could even restructure the <span class="three">core</span> to elegantly subsume all the mass from the <span class="four">hacks</span> – there isn’t that much of it!</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="106px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.060 0.707">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1.060,0 1.060,0.707 0,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>(Yes: it is ever so slightly wider. Conservation of mass, and all that.)</p>

<p>Let’s rewind a bit. What if we <em>did</em> put in the effort to move the original tiles around without redrawing the lines or moving mass between them?</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="141px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="0.707,0.707 1.414,0 1.414,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0.707,0.707 1.414,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>In a silhouette, that looks like this.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="141px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="silhouette" points="0,0 1.414,0 1.414,0.707 0.707,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>You might be able to see where this is going.</p>

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="141px" height="71px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="five" points="0.707,0 1.414,0 1.414,0.707 0.707,0.707" />
    <polygon class="six" points="0,0 0.707,0 0.707,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

<p>A different architecture! Like the other one, it’s not really a two-layer architecture anymore. The precence of the <span class="five">square</span> is an improvement, since squares have even less variability to consider than rectangles. There’s still a <span class="six">triangle</span> sticking out the side, but it matches the side of the <span class="five">square</span> perfectly: a good abstraction boundary, perhaps? Say: a minimal but fully-expressive API that is used mostly at a high level, but doesn’t prevent consumers from using the low-level parts when necessary. That sounds like a practial design to me.</p>

<p>The refactor isn’t done yet, but at least now I have a plan that is realistic, relatively less effort, and has a long-term path towards something halfway decent. Thanks, tangrams.</p>

        <p>This was a good night’s entertainment, well acted and really really tense, but I don’t think it’ll stick with me. The story is straightforward; it’s small and messy and ill-conceived; it’s probably closer than any thriller to how such a feud would play out. But it didn’t get under my skin like, say, Green Room did.</p>

        <p>I consider this movie an object lesson in how guns can make mountains out of molehills. (Even though the first murder they showed was a stabbing, the original one, before the movie started, was a shooting too.) And, I suppose, that revenge is fleeting.</p>

        <p>There was a. lot. of sex in this movie, which I suppose makes sense since Bella is effectively a teenager in an adult’s body for much of it. Taken individually, the sex scenes were amusing, but I was disappointed that they didn’t clearly delineate a single era in Bella’s life, like the black and white era, or the first-foray-into-the-real-world era. They blurred the remainder of the movie together. Not what I expected based on the first half hour.</p>

        <p>I saw a great quote from another review of this movie: just because something is anti-sexist, doesn’t mean it’s feminist. Framing empowerment through prostitution seems fraught, and the madame was more than a little exploitative herself.</p>

        <p>The guy who played Harry Astley was so, so flat in his delivery that I very quickly started to dread him ruining the scenes he was in. Was it intentional? Emma Stone though, she was incredible.</p>

        <p>I really like this movie as a dark, foul-mouthed interpretation of what a Wes Anderson movie could be.</p>

          <div class="more-thoughts spoiler">
        <p>Most of this movie felt like a meditation on how bad sleep deprivation can get. (Or a toothache.) As it accelerated it became a bit like Requiem for a Dream Lite (Ellen Burstyn’s character), complete with drugs, except in this case the hallucinations (?) were not drug-induced but a real (?) monster.</p>

        <p>In any case, the paranoia and uncertainty in the first half or two thirds were for sure the most compelling psychological horror part, but once the monster started showing up for real I lost interest. I don’t know that it would have been any better if it used the “surprise it’s just mental illness” escape hatch, though it set itself up for that. I thought the role reversal between mother and child was amusing. Almost as amusing as the Home Alone contraptions.</p>

        <p>An effect I liked in particular was right after the possession, when the mom is watching TV: the inability to focus and the quick twitches the camera makes are simple but effective.</p>

        <p>I didn’t know this was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear">King Lear</a> when I sat down to watch it, but even then it was very, very apparent that it was a screen<i>play</i> more than it was a movie. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it does have play-like storytelling in that there is a lot of telling instead of showing.</p>

        <p>The set pieces are absolutely incredible. Lots and lots of horses, yes, but the king wandering out of the burning castle while the armies part to let him pass… yowza. They really built and burned a full-size set for that.</p>

        <p>I don’t think the rise of LLMs has changed my thoughts on this movie one way or the other. Ultimately more plausible, perhaps, but they neither undermine nor support the thesis of the movie. That might be a comment more on LLMs themselves than this movie or AI generally.</p>

        <p>The first half is a legitimately scary movie, even if the snuff films started to get a bit overdone for little added effect. In particular, I like the way they explained away trope-y, spooky sounds with e.g. night terrors, or the way they demonstrated Ethan Hawke wasn’t simply going crazy because other characters corroborated some apparently-supernatural happenings.</p>

        <p>It would have been a significantly better movie if they had held the supernatural reveal until the box of movies reappears in the attic right before the end. You would have spent 95% of the movie scared about a murderous and superhumanly stealthly and methodical stalker, and then, twist, it actually <em>is</em> supernatural and the children get Ringu’d into the home movies.</p>

        <p>This one is a little less exciting for not-already-Dune-fans, and even already-Dune-fans, because it doesn’t get to introduce all the wild world-building and main characters, like the first one did. It’s still absolutely worth rewatching, though probably as part of a marathon.</p>

        <p>I found this movie exhausting. As mentioned above, the characters are comtemptible, the commentary on Gen Z culture superficial and well-trodden, and the decision-making unrealistically awful. The only tolerable non-idiotic character was Lee Pace, and even then, merely tolerable.</p>

        <p>Had I known that the movie did not intend to take itself entirely seriously I would have gone in with different expectations, but I don’t think that would have saved it. The few (in retrospect) genuinely funny lines would have registered as such, instead of coming off as the characters continuing to be obnoxious, but the juice just isn’t worth the squeeze.</p>

        <p>This movie has aged great! By focusing on the insular island culture and minimizing intrusion from the outside, it created an environment frozen in time that focuses on people and interactions, and doesn’t suffer from the “this would be done already if we had cell phones” problem.</p>

        <p>If it didn’t invent all the folk-horror tropes, it certainly solidified them. Christopher Lee is fantastic, and in fact, he has said on several occasions that it was his favorite role. Midsommar owes so, so much to this movie. It’s a tighter, higher-production-value movie, but The Wicker Man’s simpler, more earnest style is a better fit for the “folk” part of “folk-horror”.</p>

        <p>I assume in Japanese the name is a little less clunky. Do they have a single-syllable word for “one cut” so the name’s cadence is closer to Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead or whatever?</p>

        <p>I didn’t like this movie when I first watched it. It felt corny, forced, too far outside the realm of believability but without the rest of the trappings (and benefits) of a more out-there plot.</p>

        <p>But after thinking on it for some time, it’s grown on me, specifically <em>because</em> it’s such an out-there core concept in such mundane trappings. What a strange choice for a representation of… STDs? Sexual assault? Death? It’s chilling how such an innocuous action – literally, following – taken to an extreme becomes so unsettling. Plus, I thought that the characters acted pretty reasonably given the insanity they were subjected to.</p>

        <p>This is what would happen if Hemingway wrote a horror movie. In retrospect I <em>kind of</em> like it, but not because it’s likeable on its face so much as that it’s such a brazenly weird and unapologetic vision of… something. It doesn’t even matter what, it’s just the way that it carries itself. Really, it’s more of an… <em>experience</em>… than a story, but that’s not enough to actually recommend anyone else watch it.</p>

        <p>I was convinced that this movie was about mental illness right up until the very end, but the real explanation is much more fun. (Ari Aster confirmed in an interview that there is no trick. It’s what it says it is.) Just a perfectly balanced movie: freaky but believable people; unsettling but not outright hostile to the audience; a great reveal but not one that feels like a gotcha… And that decapitation scene: the perfect choice. We’ve all thought about it when we stick our hands out the car window.</p>

Minimal props, minimal sets, minimal effects: just a bunch of people as confused as the audience trying to figure things out. I loved the idea that the alternate universes varied wildly from “nobody left the house and has any idea that anything is amiss” to “murder body doubles”. Plus, blackouts are (usually) fun.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: the movie was filmed in a few days in the filmmaker’s house, and he only gave each actor their own parts and only the parts they needed for <em>that day</em> of filming. So they’re as surprised as you are.</p>

        <p>Ghosts are my least favorite kind of scare. They require a lot of suspension of disbelief but usually offer little storytelling oomph in return, often less than pagan gods, or witches, or zombies, or those sorts of things.</p>

        <p>I did like some elements and characters of this film, especially the older couple running the orphanage. The child actors are not bad, though the makeup on the ghost boy sure is. I wanted to like it more than I did, and it still feels a little harsh to recommend not watching it, but I’d pick most other horror movies on this list first, for sure.</p>

Framing the hand as a party drug was, to my knowledge, a unique approach that allowed to characters to behave like realistically risky, smartphone-wielding teenagers.</p>

        <p>The visual effects struck the perfect balance of creepy without going overboard, and the increasingly-unsubtle audio-visual cues of the possessive underworld woman were a nice touch.</p>

        <p>I love the self-imposed challenge of making a horror movie in broad daylight. I think folk horror, or at least, this strain of it, is all about the pacing, and Midsommar absolutely nails the pacing. You can’t come on too quickly, otherwise you’d scare off the characters/audience who are largely pretty reasonable. Midsommar takes its time, but it never stops: the ramp-up is relentlessly steady; every scene just a little more weird than the last until you realize you’re way past your comfort zone and how did we get here?</p>

        <p>What a mind fuck. This is Aronofsky at his finest. The thing that stuck out the most to me was the visual metaphors for euphoria, paranoia and hallucinations. The editing and camerawork for those did an excellent job conveying a <em>feeling</em> that put you in the character’s shoes.</p>

        <p>The parallel storylines showing four different versions of the same idea, and four different ways they can all go horribly wrong (and worse when they play off of each other), weave together into a surprisingly coherent storyline. At least, as coherent as it can be through the drug haze. I didn’t even find the moral of the story too blunt: we all know where this leads, and the movie did all showing and no telling.</p>

        <p>Full disclosure: I was told, and went in expecting, that this was a horror movie. It’s not. It starts out sort of like one, but once they figure out it’s a UFO-alien, it becomes almost like a heist movie where you spend the first two thirds of the movie gathering the team and the equipment and the last third of the movie executing the heist. Which is fine, and kind of an interesting idea when mashed up like this, but I would rather they just did that from the start and made a different movie instead.</p>

        <p>There were some clever storywriting bits in the “heist” section of the movie, for sure, but the rules felt a little arbitrary and the I-guess-horror-related shots of the inside of the UFO-alien felt more gratuitous and irrelevant to the story than anything else.</p>

        <p>Us is like Jordan Peele’s perfect second follow up album to his #1 charting Get Out. It has a very similar feel but otherwise bears no relation. It’s got quite a bit of worldbuilding, and the fantastical bent of it permits the more overtly weird aspects – like the scissors, or the raspy voices – to blend and contribute rather than stick out as awkward. I really liked the raspy voices in particular: how creepy, that you talk so little that you aren’t even sure how to do it properly anymore.</p>

<h3 id="racking-and-the-break">Racking and the Break</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Rack with the 1 ball at the apex, the 8 ball in the middle, one solid and one stripe in each of the other corners, and the rest randomly. The 1 is placed on the foot spot. [3.2]</li>
  <li>Lag to determine order of play. Winner chooses to break or have opponent break. [1.2] [3.1]</li>
  <li>Table remains open even if a ball is pocketed. [3.3]</li>
  <li>Fouls on the break are opponent’s choice: [3.3]
    <ul>
      <li>Accept the balls in position.</li>
      <li>Ball-in-hand, behind the head string.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="play-and-winning">Play and Winning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The intended ball and pocket must be called if they are not obvious. [1.6] [3.6]</li>
  <li>The shooter continues as long as they pocket shots as called and do not foul. Pocketing additional balls is not a foul and does not end the turn. [3.5]</li>
  <li>The shooter may call “safety”, in which case the turn changes even if they pocket a ball legally. [8.17] [3.6]</li>
  <li>Fouling while pocketing the 8 ball is a loss. [3.8]</li>
  <li>Fouling on an 8 ball attempt without pocketing the 8 ball is treated as a normal foul. (My clarification; implied but not stated explicitly in the rules.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fouls">Fouls</h3>

<p>All fouls are ball in hand without restriction, except as noted during the break.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scratch (pocketed cue). [6.1]</li>
  <li>Wrong first ball. [6.2]</li>
  <li>No contact. [6.3]</li>
  <li>No rail after contact. [6.3]</li>
  <li>Bad play from behind the head string. [6.11]</li>
  <li>Jump shots by “scooping”. [8.16]</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat a non-stick or well-seasoned griddle or small pan to medium-low. Pancakes are very sensitive to uneven heating, so use multiple small pans instead of one large one if you need more space. (This will allow centering the pancakes over the burners.) Pancakes are more like baking than cooking, so having an evenly heated surface ready to go will make it much easier to dial in the temperature as you cook. Don’t butter or oil the pan, as this will cause the pancakes end up splotchy.</p>

<p>In a large bowl, mix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 cup flour</li>
  <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>½ tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
</ul>

<p>In a small bowl, mix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ones and combine throughly. Add:</p>

<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
</ul>

<p>until you have a smooth, thick and just-barely-evenly-pourable batter. When in doubt, err on the side of thicker: you can always add more milk.</p>

<p>To make a pancake, put about ¼ cup batter into the center of the pan. (The batter is thick, so you can use a ⅓ cup measure to pour quickly without having to scrape down the sides.)</p>

<p>Cook a couple minutes, checking the bottom with a spatula and flipping when it’s an even, deep golden brown. The top should be bubbling lightly, but without the bubbles bursting.</p>

<p>Cook until the other side has golden brown patches. (This side will be unavoidably splotchy.)</p>

<p>Serve face up.</p>

Compare the predecessor<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">Nixie tube</a>, which is also cool for different reasons, but needs 10 elements to display all 10 digits. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen-segment_display">14-segment displays</a> can do all 26 letters and 10 numbers.)</p>

<p>Unlike with a Nixie tube, numbers have to be hammered into slightly awkward shapes to fit into a 7-segment display. But we can turn this constraint on its head to find something new! By enumerating all the alphanumeric-like shapes that aren’t already claimed, we might be able to make up some new alphanumeric shapes that feel familiar, but aren’t.</p>

<p>These were made using a <a href="/assets/seven-segment/generate.txt">Python script</a> according to a few simple (and somewhat arbitrary) rules derived from observing the standard 10 digit patterns. They must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full height</li>
  <li>connected into a single glyph (no floating “dots” or bars)</li>
  <li>not already a number or letter (obviously)</li>
</ul>

<p>As an aside, something interesting I notice is that my brain is really good at reinterpreting the “backwards” or “broken” shapes: for instance, it really wants to read <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="fegb" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> as 4 and <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="abcge" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> as A.</p>

<p>Anyway, here is me riffing on the 7-segment shapes to see what more-natural shapes come out in handwriting.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find that many of these shapes, written at speed, are near indifferentiable from existing characters (e.g. <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="abge" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> as question mark) or even multiple distinct characters (e.g. <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="40px" viewBox="-1 -1 12 20" class="seven-segment" data-segments="fgcd" data-inline="">  <polygon class="a" points=" 1, 1  2, 0  8, 0  9, 1  8, 2  2, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="b" points=" 9, 1 10, 2 10, 8  9, 9  8, 8  8, 2"></polygon>  <polygon class="c" points=" 9, 9 10,10 10,16  9,17  8,16  8,10"></polygon>  <polygon class="d" points=" 9,17  8,18  2,18  1,17  2,16  8,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="e" points=" 1,17  0,16  0,10  1, 9  2,10  2,16"></polygon>  <polygon class="f" points=" 1, 9  0, 8  0, 2  1, 1  2, 2  2, 8"></polygon>  <polygon class="g" points=" 1, 9  2, 8  8, 8  9, 9  8,10  2,10"></polygon></svg> as either uppercase S or lowercase b).

  Units: 
  <a href="#" id="unit-switcher-metric">metric</a>
   • 
  <a href="#" id="unit-switcher-imperial">stupid</a>
</span></p>

<p>Preheat the oven to <span class="unit metric">160°C</span><span class="unit imperial">325°F</span>.</p>

<p>Prepare the dry ingredients. In a large bowl, mix <span class="unit metric">75-150g</span><span class="unit imperial">½ to ¾ cup</span> each of any seeds and nuts you’d like. I usually use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="unit metric">80g</span><span class="unit imperial">½ cup</span> pumpkin seeds (salted, roasted)</li>
  <li><span class="unit metric">80g</span><span class="unit imperial">½ cup</span> sunflower seeds</li>
  <li><span class="unit metric">80g</span><span class="unit imperial">½ cup</span> sliced almonds</li>
  <li><span class="unit metric">140g</span><span class="unit imperial">¾ cup</span> whole almonds (salted, roasted)</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix briefly with your hands, then add</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="unit metric">1kg</span><span class="unit imperial">2 lb.</span> rolled oats</li>
</ul>

<p>and again mix briefly with your hands.</p>

<p>Then create the syrupy sauce business. In a sauce pan, combine</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="unit metric">140g</span><span class="unit imperial">½ cup</span> brown sugar</li>
  <li><span class="unit metric">170g</span><span class="unit imperial">¾ cup</span> vegetable oil</li>
  <li><span class="unit metric">200g</span><span class="unit imperial">½ cup</span> honey</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="unit metric"></span><span class="unit imperial">in that order (to minimize sticking to your measuring device),</span> and cook over medium heat until the bubbles mostly subside.</p>

<p>Create a small well in the oat-nut mixture and pour the sauce into it. (The well prevents the sugar magma from contacting the bowl immediately, in case your bowl is not very heat-safe.) Mix with a large spoon until there are no more dry spots. Pro tip: start soaking the sauce pan and spoon now to clean them faster.</p>

<p>Coat each of <span class="unit metric">two 40 cm by 30 cm</span><span class="unit imperial">two 18” by 13”</span> rimmed baking sheets with</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Spread the granola mixture evenly across them about <span class="unit metric">1.5 cm</span><span class="unit imperial">½”</span> deep and, for extra credit, leave a <span class="unit metric">1 cm</span><span class="unit imperial">½”</span> buffer around the edge to prevent overcooking. (If you need to do batches: the raw granola is about <span class="unit metric">1900g</span><span class="unit imperial">3½ lb.</span> all together.)</p>

<p>Bake for 25-35 minutes, rotating and switching racks halfway through for even cooking.</p>

<p>Remove from oven and allow to cool for about 20 minutes, at which point the granola should be partly pliable, partly crunchy – perfect for snapping into bite-size chunks. Use a metal spatula to scrape it off the baking sheets. (If you prefer atomized granola, allow to cool longer, whereupon it will shatter into a million pieces when you try to get it off the sheets.)</p>

<p>Store at room temperature and consume with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Note that there are a <em>lot</em> of ordinaries and charges in real blazons, along with many slight variations in phrasing, which aren’t all supported. Check <a href="/assets/blazonry/grammar.txt">the formal grammar</a> if you want specifics. Here’s some real ones you can try out, too:</p>

      <p>Like the Bavarian arms, some changes had to be made to the official blazoning. I don’t support phrasings like “of the first” (dispreferred <a href="https://heraldry.sca.org/armory/bruce.html">“Victorianisms”</a> ctrl-f “victorian”), the million different ways of specifying quarterings, or the underspecified “as augmentation” phrasing for inescutcheons.

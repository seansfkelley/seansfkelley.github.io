If you’re here, I probably sent you because you nagged me to play Commander. But I don’t like Commander, and here’s why.</p>

<p><strong>The board states are massively overcomplicated.</strong> I <em>do</em> like intricate multi-hour Euro games, but that’s not the itch that Magic scratches for me. I think Magic is at its best when games are quick and spunky and where the opponents bring clearly-distinct styles, like tennis. The ~400 unique cards in a Commander dramatically amplify the complexity that Wizards keeps adding<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> when compared to the ~40 unique cards in a Constructed game.</p>

<p><strong>Games quickly become swingy slugfests.</strong> Board wipes followed by dumping huge sorceries (or whatever). Lurching between different piles of cards is inelegant and loses out on all the fun subtleties in navigating a well-built deck between your opponent’s swings to land a fatal blow.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t like politicking and managing social dynamics.</strong> In Commander, I avoid knocking someone out of a game early even if that’s the right strategy because it sucks when that happens to you. You don’t generally have to worry about peoples’ feelings in Constructed. (I also can’t stand Diplomacy.)</p>

<p><strong>Like the much-loathed companion cycle, a commander negatively warps deckbuilding around it.</strong> A lot of decks feel like random in-color cards that are good with the commander and bad without it. Decks with single points of failure (success?) are antithetical to my deckbuilding style, which is also a big part of the reason I don’t like combo decks or tutors.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> I want, and build, decks with lots of little synergies so that there’s always something available, but not the same thing every time.</p>

<p><strong>The decks take a <em>long</em> time to hone.</strong> To be clear, I still spend a lot of time refining my Constructed decks, but you can get a working first draft pretty quickly. In a Constructed deck, substituting even a single playset will often change the feel of a deck noticeably in a way that keeps the feedback loop rewarding and lets you explore more adjacent playstyles without being held back by the required interactions with (or color restrictions of) the commander.</p>

<p><strong>Old cards are ugly.</strong> There, I said it. (To be fair, a lot of new card frames are ugly too. At least the old cards are not near-impossible to read. But I’d rather have neither.)</p>

<p>Last time I tried to build a Commander deck, I ended up throwing out the 80% of it that was chaff, and kept the 20% that was fun. And then I put in 4 copies of each card. Oops.</p>

      <p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with increasing the complexity of the game, if it’s done tastefully. But recently Wizards has started adding a lot of state to manage, some of which doesn’t have a good physical representation. Exert is one such mechanic (how many times I have accidentally untapped an exerted thing…), and good luck remembering the 4,000 different types of behaviors available to cards in exile depending on how they got there. All of this before we even get to Wizards printing new sets at <em>breakneck</em> speed with some straight-up shitty mechanics, then having the gall to “reprint” the set <em>while it’s being printed for the first time</em> because Daddy Hasbro is too cheap to shell out for all the rights to Spiderman. Fuck you, Hasbro. (Note that this should not be taken to mean I would prefer more Spiderman cards. Universes Beyond is fucking awful, and I’ve hamstrung my own decks a few times just to avoid some of the more egregious crossovers.) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>My rule of thumb is that any interaction requiring three cards should be considered pure bonus upside, perhaps shading into win-more, and not required for the deck to work. (Unless one of them is lands, since they are always around.) Three-card interactions are often too fragile to be fun or end up with the deck being a tedious tutor/control/delay shell around those three cards. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can only do this for 3 apps at a time.</li>
  <li>You have to put your phone into “developer mode”, which Apple describes in vaguely threatening language regarding security.</li>
  <li>You need to leave something running on your computer and be on the same network as it at least one a week.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternately, you could just move to the EU or lobby your congressperson to get off their fucking asses and do something useful instead of vomiting something about “innovation” and “small businesses” while sucking off a billionaire.</p>

<h3 id="the-actual-tutorial">The Actual Tutorial</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Install <a href="https://altstore.io/#Downloads">AltServer</a> on your computer and AltStore on your iPhone. <a href="https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/how-to-install-altstore-macos">Details.</a>
    <ul>
      <li>You probably want to enable the AltServer &gt; Launch at Login menu option.</li>
      <li>If you can’t see your phone in Finder after unplugging it, try Apple menu &gt; Force Quit… &gt; Finder &gt; Relaunch.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Build an unsigned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ipa</code> bundle using Xcode (as far as it’s willing to help).
    <ol>
      <li>Product &gt; Archive (in Xcode 16), which should open the Xcode Organizer showing the build.</li>
      <li>Right-click the build and Show in Finder to reveal the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.xcarchive</code>. It’s a directory, so pop it open (right-click &gt; Show Package Contents, or just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>) and find the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Products/Applications</code>.</li>
      <li>Pull the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> out and plop it in a new empty directory somewhere called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Payload</code>.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zip -r &lt;app&gt;.ipa Payload</code> to finish the unsigned bundle.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Get the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ipa</code> onto your phone somehow.
    <ul>
      <li>Apple makes this really fucking annoying to do through the Files app,<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> so I just used my Dropbox. iCloud Drive (and other similar things) probably also work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In AltStore, go to My Apps &gt; + &gt; navigate to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ipa</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>Note that it starts you down a directory – hit the back button to see other file systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That should be it! You can test the wireless refreshing by tapping “7 Days” in the newly-installed app listing.</p>

I think the problem is that we’re talking past each other: there are different ways to be a bad driver.</p>

<p>I hereby propose a rating system with three axes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>incompetence</strong></li>
  <li><strong>negligence</strong></li>
  <li><strong>aggression</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some example applications for some places I’m familiar with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>NorCal:</strong> incompetent and negligent, but emphatically passive</li>
  <li><strong>Italy:</strong> hyper-aggressive, but by and large competent and usually attentive</li>
  <li><strong>New York City:</strong> all sliders to <em>maximum</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I think disagreements happen when your bad drivers and their bad drivers are at even moderately-different positions along these axes.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while it’s obvious that minimal incompetence and minimal negligence is objectively good, the same is not true for aggression. Drivers that are too passive cause traffic flow problems and annoy other drivers – rightfully, I’d say, if you won’t pull into the intersection on green when you’re waiting to turn left.</p>

The process is tedious, it’s difficult to understand how well it’s working, and I sometimes wonder if it’s worth it, since credit bureaus and insurance companies are basically handing out your PII to hackers.</p>

<p>I persist because it buys me peace of mind and because I’m too principled to concede the point. I try to be somewhat pragmatic about it, and there are instances where I trade privacy for convenience. This makes Google a particularly thorny case, since I value the services they provide – unlike Facebook, which I left years ago and often forget still exists.</p>

<p>This post outlines my de-Googling strategy.</p>

<h2 id="search--kagi">Search → <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a></h2>

<p>Yes: I pay for my search engine. It turns out that if you drink zero cups of coffee a day, the “cheaper than a cup of coffee” marketing play works. In fact… it works better? I have a larger budget for coffee-priced things.</p>

<p>For a long time I used <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> (and I still use it when I’m on someone else’s computer or I can’t be bothered to set up my Kagi account on a device), but I found the quality of the search results barely better than Google, which itself has undergone a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+search+results+are+getting+worse">well-documented decline</a>. Perhaps this is because they’re both advertising-driven, so their incentives aren’t totally aligned with their users.</p>

<p>Kagi, being a pay-for service, only makes money if it serves users’ needs. Imagine that! They churn out features like crazy, including a <em>lot</em> to customize your search results, as well as a bunch of random other services I couldn’t really care less about. It’s really lovely to be able to uprank/downrank sites.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Admittedly, the vast majority of my searches are pretty simplistic,<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> usually ending on Wikipedia, StackOverflow, IMDb… so the bar isn’t terribly high. I occasionally dip back into Google with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!g</code> (<a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html">bangs</a> are a feature they totally stole from DuckDuckGo), but 100% of the time I find the same bad results, so I should really stop bothering.</p>

<h2 id="chrome--firefox">Chrome → <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a></h2>

<p>It’s the same. You’ll be fine, trust me. Using Firefox is like driving a Saab – a <em>perfectly suitable tool</em> for your needs, but because it died out and nobody sees it anymore, you get looks and people assume you’re weird and/or totally out of touch.</p>

<p>I switched to Chrome like everybody else back in the 2010s when it was the hot new thing and Firefox was dog slow, but even though Firefox itself hasn’t <em>quite</em> kept pace (though <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/">the big change in 2017</a> really made a huge difference), computers and connections have gotten faster so it’s not noticeable in real life. What is noticeable is Chrome sucking up all my memory and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome/">normalizing stalker-ish behavior</a> (which they later <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/product-updates-based-your-feedback/">backpedaled on</a>, sort of).</p>

<h2 id="gmail--fastmail">Gmail → <a href="https://fastmail.com">Fastmail</a></h2>

<p>This was the big one. I spent months hemming and hawing on whether I wanted to uproot my entire online identity and replace it with another one. I finally did sometime in 2020, and it’s been… uneventful. The world did not come crumbling down around me, though I’m still in the process of shifting accounts over to the new address. The old account will necessarily have to live forever – it’s in too many places, some of which don’t allow me to change it.</p>

<p>The biggest uncertainty was Fastmail’s quality of spam filtering. Five years later, I can say: perfectly fine. I can recall two incidents where things I needed were erroneously flagged as spam, and one where spam made it to my inbox.</p>

<p>A component of my strategy here involves heavy usage of the masked email addresses. Only real people and important services (or those with KYC protocols, like banks and airlines) get a real email address. This is annoying to enforce and admittedly has not really yielded many benefits, but I’ll keep doing it for peace of mind. I am legitimately surprised at how few companies seem to actually sell my masked email addresses to spammers.</p>

<p>I decided against <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a> because I’m willing to trade off a lack of end-to-end encryption for the convenience of being able to use any client I want anywhere and have it just work. That is, after all, the magic of federated protocols!</p>

<h2 id="maps--apple-maps">Maps → <a href="https://maps.apple.com/">Apple Maps</a></h2>

<p>(With apologies to non-Mac, non-iPhone users.)</p>

<p>Apple Maps used to suck. Like, really bad. It’s improved dramatically in the years since its release, and the only things I ever return to Google Maps for are to check suspicious-looking opening hours, which are <em>occasionally</em> wrong in Apple Maps.</p>

<p>This particular transition has been so successful that whenever I do end up in Google Maps, I find it an overwhelming and unpleasant place to be. The interface is laggy, packed with ads, and bombards you with buttons and completely useless location pins apparently pulled out of a hat. Why??<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Apple Maps is refreshingly direct and crisp, and really only shows you information you ask for.</p>

<p>That said: the search, um, leaves something to be desired. Thankfully, like with Kagi, my search needs are pretty basic – find things by their name, or just the word “gas” – so it gets the job done. Also, I don’t use any of the Yelp-like or custom map/pin features of Google Maps, of which Apple Maps doesn’t have a lot. I use Yelp.</p>

<h2 id="youtube--nebula-max-infuse-and-youtube">YouTube → <a href="https://watchnebula.com/">Nebula</a>, <a href="https://www.max.com/">Max</a>, <a href="https://firecore.com/">Infuse</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a></h2>

<p>Okay, this one is basically impossible to get rid of. It so happens that I subscribe to a lot of channels that are also on Nebula, which I gladly pay $3/month for. I only ever watch YouTube on an Apple TV, so I gave it its own Google account to keep it away from the remains of my real one.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Thankfully, since YouTube is just glorified television, the privacy risk seems minimal. To me, it’s more important to be able to pay to get rid of the ads <em>and</em> have that pay go towards (usually) higher-quality content instead of all the clickbait garbage on YouTube.</p>

<h2 id="drive-docs-sheets--icloud-drive-apple-pages-apple-numbers">Drive, Docs, Sheets… → <a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/">iCloud Drive</a>, Apple Pages, Apple Numbers…</h2>

<p>(With more apologies to non-Mac, non-iPhone users.)</p>

<p>I barely use any of these, so this was an easy transition to make.</p>

<p>I have one primary computer, with backups, so I don’t see much upside to keeping things on Drive. As a programmer, I use my text editor for almost all text-based work, writing maybe one “document” a year. Spreadsheets are usually one-off a couple times a year, so Numbers’ mediocre (but much prettier!) reimplementation of Excel is perfectly serviceable.</p>

<p>I recently started using iCloud Drive for a bunch of shared documents, which was an option available to me, but I only chose it over <a href="https://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> because Dropbox seems like a dying company and the product is really pretty ugly and clunky now.</p>

<h2 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The Elephant in the Room</h2>

<p>Yeah, a lot of what I did was to swap one big tech company for another.</p>

<p>This is a conscious decision I made as part of the convenience/privacy tradeoff. I’m unsure how honest I think Apple’s apparent commitment to privacy is (though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%E2%80%93FBI_encryption_dispute">San Bernadino shooter incident</a> was definitely some good press for them), but since they make money off of hardware and being a services middleman, instead of advertising, it’s much more believeable than the company that <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/google-motto-dont-be-evil/">retracted “don’t be evil” as an unofficial slogan</a>.</p>

<p>With each passing year, the gap between competitors for the commoditized digital products that make up almost this entire list – here meaning primarily Apple, but also sometimes-crappy open source alternatives – closes. If I need to jump ship to OpenStreetMap, I won’t be entirely happy, but it’ll be a lot more usable than it was five years ago.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-do-it-too">You can do it too!</h2>

<p>We’re so conditioned to associate digital convenience and safety with the big names, but that’s an illusion born, I suspect, from sheer ubiquity instead of any unique technical merit. I also think we’re too quick to dismiss something that’s 95% as good as the incumbent because one naturally wants <em>the best</em>. Do you actually use that last 5%? It is worth shipping all your data to Google so that you avoid being misled one time a year about opening hours?</p>

<p>It feels liberating to take back some control over this stuff. For my data to (largely) be my own, insulated from the risk of my online life being smashed underfoot as Google lumbers around locking accounts without recourse because you did one thing that makes you look like a statistical outlier.</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Yorkers are assholes.</li>
  <li>Anyone, put behind the wheel of a car, becomes a monster.</li>
</ul>

<p>The unholy combination of these things yields some of the most <em>effortful</em> douchebaggery you’ll find anywhere in the world. Take, for instance, my Halloween 2022: literally hundreds of children and their parents milling around combined with a partial street closure created some bad traffic on the block, which some jackass in a minivan decided to keep everyone within earshot informed about by leaning on his horn for ten straight minutes uninterrupted. Un. <em>In.</em> <strong><em>Terr.</em></strong> <strong><em>UPTED.</em></strong> TENFULLMINUTES.</p>

<p>While unnecessarily excessive honking is one of the more archetypical New York examples, the city provides triggers for any pet peeve imaginable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standing in doorways</li>
  <li>blocking the sidewalk</li>
  <li>blasting music</li>
  <li>blindingly bright signage</li>
  <li>4 AM yelling</li>
  <li>bad parking jobs</li>
  <li>name-calling</li>
  <li>walking too slowly</li>
  <li>entering while people are exiting</li>
  <li>cutting lines</li>
  <li>video advertisements</li>
  <li>manspreading</li>
  <li>not holding doors</li>
</ul>

<p>…you get the point. If it’s obnoxious and in public, New York has it in spades.</p>

<p>Moving along from the venting, I present you another true fact:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias">Negative events are remembered and internalized better than positive ones.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is some kind of reptile-brain survival instinct we’re stuck with. What it means is that the only way to tolerate life in New York is to at least become inured to it – “it” being New York and everything in it, to be clear, in case you’re still uncertain of my stance on this matter. Most likely, you’ll participate passively since some amount of assholery just inadvertently happens in the course of trying to get where you’re going. For a chosen few, like our minivan driver, you’ll make it a point to participate actively.</p>

<p>It does not take many people doing this, passive or active, to make life miserable in what I call the</p>

<p><em><strong>~ ~ ~ Blast Radius of Inconsideracy ~ ~ ~</strong></em></p>

<p>(Hey, it’s the title of the post!)</p>

<p>For an explanatory example, I return to honking (for which <a href="/honking">I have already developed a solution</a>, by the way, and you’re welcome): if someone cuts you off, you become angry. If you honk at them, you reflect some of that anger back at them, which is fine, but also at everyone within earshot. Venting does help, but not much, so all-in it’s actually <em>you</em> that has contributed far more shittiness to the environment than the person who cut you off. Congratulations, you’re the villain now. It escalates from there.</p>

<p>These interactions happen everywhere. What’s unique about New York in my experience is the frequency of them observed by any one person. If you saw the correct half of Barbenheimer, you may have learned a thing or two about self-sustaining nuclear reactions: it’s not enough to have high-energy matter flying about, you also need enough matter crammed into a small enough space that collisions are frequent enough to keep the whole thing going, and in fact, you can start such a self-sustaining reaction simply by piling enough matter in one place <em>without</em> any explicit ignition.</p>

<p>I think you get the analogy,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I want to put a finer point on that last part: the culture of the schmuck emerges not necessarily from something inherent about New Yorkers, even ones who voluntarily move or stay there presumably knowing what they’re signing up for, but from both the sheer quantity of people and their density, compounded over the years. It arises from the blast radius of inconsideracy, from inevitable negative interactions that irradiate everyone nearby with their negativity. It’s not good.</p>

<p>And that’s it, really. I don’t have any bright ideas on how to improve it. Do you?</p>

Or rather, it took several years of me trying out different bar trivias to find one I really like. When I’m out of town I’ll try out the local trivia, or even when I’m not, I’ll sometimes go see what other bars are putting on near where I live.</p>

<p>And so: I went to one recently that was so un-fun I left part way through. It really helped put into focus what it is about my local place that I like. These are my observations about what makes good bar trivia, in no particular order.</p>

<p>An important disclaimer: while I like winning and I like being right, I also go to trivia to see my friends. Trivia leagues are… fine. Some are done better than others. Many (but not all) of the observations here can apply equally well to casual as well as serious trivia.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="score-entire-rounds-at-once">Score entire rounds at once.</h3>

<p>Like a good crossword puzzle, a good trivia round may not be solveable top-to-bottom on the first try. Ask 10 questions, write 10 answers, score 10 answers. Scoring every question as you go introduces a lot of time pressure and sucks out a lot of the fun of rooting around in your subconscious for the answer. It feels like an exam, except that even exams don’t do this.</p>

<p>Scoring-as-you-go also eliminates the possibility of being able to figure out a round’s theme (if present), and then go back and cross-check your answers against the theme. This makes theme rounds more of a chore and less of a reward.</p>

<h3 id="ask-locally-relevant-versions-of-questions">Ask locally-relevant versions of questions.</h3>

<p>I was once asked a question about something that had happened to Steph Curry a week or so before. I had no idea what it was because I don’t follow basketball, but it was definitely my fault because I was in San Francisco.</p>

<p>At the un-fun trivia, I was asked a question about who took Brett Favre’s place in a game in 2007. Not only was that 17 years out of date, but it was for a team thousands of miles away. I didn’t consider the fact that I got it wrong my fault, even though every football fan considers it obvious.</p>

<p>The distinction I’m trying to make here is that the Steph Curry question isn’t purely a sports question. It’s also asking “do you pay attention to things that are important to people around you, even if they aren’t important to you?” The Brett Favre question, by contrast, is a curt “do you watch football?”. The former is both much more engaging in its flavor and delivery, and gives a glimmer of hope to those who aren’t basketball fans.</p>

<p>(Yes, I understand these are different sports, but in trivia, all sports are generally considered to be a single category together. Kind of like all history is one category.)</p>

<h3 id="provide-context-instead-of-just-stating-the-question-outright">Provide context instead of just stating the question outright.</h3>

<p>Given an answer, there are are million versions of a trivia question that can get there. So instead of choosing something short and dry – “Who played the title role in the 1992 movie Bram Stoker’s Dracula?” – give people who aren’t simply encyclopedias something to latch onto to feel like they have a fighting chance of deducing the answer indirectly: “Born in 1958, which English actor often described as a chameleon played the title role in the 1992 movie Bram Stoker’s Dracula?”</p>

<p>(That would be Gary Oldman, by the way. My go-to example of a chameleon of an actor.)</p>

<h3 id="use-paper-not-a-phone">Use paper, not a phone.</h3>

<p>I’m here to hang out at a bar and participate in a group activity. Don’t make me look at my own phone, which is part of what I’m trying to avoid by being out of the house and around other people. If I can do it on my phone, why am I even here? Let’s just do trivia alone at home.</p>

<p>Less is more, in this case. Plus, scoring paper forces a natural lull, so the trivia isn’t an endless assault of questions where you’re afraid to even leave to go to the bathroom. (You could do that with phone-based trivia too, but it seems like the temptation to accelerate is usually given into.)</p>

<h3 id="dont-make-the-spelling-count">Don’t make the spelling count.</h3>

<p>It’s trivia, not a spelling bee. What if you know the answer, but have never seen it written down, like some famous person’s unusual name? Penalizing that is not fun, it’s just hostile.</p>

<p>If we’re talking Serious Business trivia, there is an argument to be made that the correct spelling is an easily-drawn, non-controversial line for where the points are awarded and where they are not. To which I say: if a question’s answer’s spelling is not excruciatingly obvious (i.e. common English words) <em>and</em> isn’t well-known enough in its written form such that to know the fact is to know the spelling, it’s a bad question. Not every question with a clear answer can be a trivia question.</p>

<p>Tell me, can you spell that famous pharaoh’s name correctly? What about Jake G. what’s-his-face, the actor from Donnie Darko? Compare, for example, that poetic Greek Z-word we sometimes used for the wind. If you know the answer, surely you know the spelling.</p>

<h3 id="most-rounds-should-have-a-bare-minimum-of-theme">Most rounds should have a bare minimum of theme.</h3>

<p>Trivia that is constantly swinging violently between pop culture, history, geography, science, etc., gets tiring. Everyone is on high alert all the time, and you rob people of the opportunity to get in the groove if the theme is something they know a bit about.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be a strong theme. “Current events” is a fine theme. It means: I read the news relatively recently, and now I should focus on dredging up all the stuff I remember seeing in the last couple weeks. It gives a light sense of focus without excluding most participants.</p>

<p>Note also the “most”. It’s okay to have a general round or two. Put it between stronger theme rounds as a break, or at the beginning as a warmup. The point is to work with the round-based structure of trivia instead of having a wall of undifferentiated questions that are arbitrarily grouped into sets of 8 or 10 or 12 with no rhyme or reason.</p>

<h3 id="mix-up-the-question-formats">Mix up the question formats.</h3>

<p>Continuing on the topic of avoiding an undifferentiated mass of questions: mix up the formats. It doesn’t need to be wild, out-of-the-box multimedia nonsense, I just don’t want an endless recital of facts and figures with question marks at the end.</p>

<p>There are strong examples of this, like music, picture or under/over/true/false rounds, but it only takes a couple questions structured differently within an otherwise themeless round to give it a little spice.</p>

<p>Examples I’ve seen of this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>categorical questions, where multiple things are named and you have to say what kind of thing they are</li>
  <li>questions with multiple answers, of which you get points for each one (and perhaps with a limit, so you don’t <em>have</em> to know all 15 correct answers)</li>
  <li>even the relatively mundane complete-the-quote can interrupt the monotony a bit!</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="no_toc" id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Taken together, one might say that these are a variety of ways to say “trivia is fun when it’s easier”. To some degree, that’s true – it’s less fun to lose, but it’s really anti-fun to lose by a lot or even to feel like you never had a chance.</p>

<p>But anyway, what’s the point of <em>hard</em> trivia? I see only two: to make the winners feel better, and to clearly separate the winners from the losers. To the first point: who cares. To the second point: this can be done in a way that is more flavorful and engaging for the losers, such as by sprinkling only a couple really hard questions in among the regular ones. You don’t need huge margins to separate the winner.</p>

<p>Trivia leagues excepted, bar trivia is for <em>fun</em>. Competitions are fun when they are engaging while they happen and close when they end.</p>

<p>I previously used (and adored) one of <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">these</a>:</p>

<p>This post is a review of the Glove80 with frequent comparisons to the ErgoDox, since it was my baseline for years.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="feel">Feel</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The housing is nicely minimalist, with no chin or forehead.</strong></p>

    <p>I appreciate this type of minimalism. Large expanses of empty housing like on a regular keyboard, or even the thick (vertically) and slightly wider (horizontally) housing on an ErgoDox makes it feel like an ungainly behemoth in comparison. This does have the unintended side effect of making the carrying case feel even more enormous than it already objectively is. (More on that later.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The halves are so light that they don’t dampen vibrations very well.</strong></p>

    <p>This is relative and not terribly noticeable until you switch back to another keyboard that does. It’s a bit like being in a room that echoes slightly and not noticing until you go to a room that dampens echoes properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The low profile keys are quieter and a little mushier than mechnical keyboards with keys that bottom out.</strong></p>

    <p>The keys are <em>way</em> less satisfying to strike than the heavy bottoming-out you get on more standard mechanical keyboards like the ErgoDox. Since they don’t bottom out, using non-clicky switches will make the keyboard almost silent, which is a nice option if you’re into that. If you aren’t, consider using clicky switches if you’re not normally the type to.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The integrated wrist rests are slippery and too small for those with large hands.</strong></p>

    <p>My palms dangle off the near edge of the wrist rests. This would be tolerable, but not great, except that they’re also pretty smooth so I’m constantly aware of my hands’ positioning in order to keep them from slipping off the near edge. I actually use the huge rubber brick wrist rests that came with the ErgoDox, which I love, and have disconnected the integrated rests. It’s a shame, because having exactly two pieces in total to wrangle would be really nice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="build-quality">Build Quality</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The housing design is prone to damage and seems to be made of relatively soft plastic.</strong></p>

    <p>I accidentally dropped one half a couple inches onto the desk and now there are permanently dulled corners with obvious damage. I don’t know why they didn’t bevel it like the ErgoDox to avoid this kind of damage. Pieces of the case aren’t completely flush with one another, though that’s only on the bottom where it’s usually out of sight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The low profile switches and keycaps rattle slightly when you move the keyboard around.</strong></p>

    <p>The rattling only happens when moving it around, not when typing, but every time I pick it up to pack it it reminds me that it feels a little cheap. The ErgoDox does not rattle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The carrying case that it comes with is very nice, if bulky.</strong></p>

    <p>The two halves fit very snugly into their molded holders and there’s a little room to spare for replacement parts and the relevant tools (like the keycap puller). I would not trust the keyboard to survive unprotected in a backpack or duffel, so the case is a welcome addition. On the other hand, the ErgoDox is indestructible and is therefore in some ways easier to travel with, despite all the associated bits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The switches (and PCB?) are easily broken when replacing keycaps.</strong></p>

    <p>I broke one within a week by pulling out the keycaps too hard (which, to be fair, they warn you about). The keycaps <em>really</em> grip the switches and can jostle the switches around when being replaced, and unlike the ErgoDox the switches aren’t hot-swappable. It was a two-week affair to buy replacements and get a friend to solder it on, but it broke again within a month (PCB damage?) so I just stopped using that location. I broke a couple switches on my ErgoDox but never had to change my keymap to compensate since they could be hot-swapped.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The concavity takes a while to get used to, but makes <em>so many keys</em> available.</strong></p>

    <p>This is the first concave keyboard I’ve owned. It wasn’t difficult to get passably efficient, but it took a couple months before I stopped hitting adjacent keys by accident because they were closer than I was used to. In exchange, every finger gets comfortable access to 5 keys (doubled, for the index/pinky, them being on the edge) compared to the 3-4 on the ErgoDox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The per-finger curvature and offset is <em>excellent</em>, excepting the pinky which should be more curved.</strong></p>

    <p>For the index/middle/ring fingers, all keys feel equally reachable without any preference for the middle finger (it being longer). The pinky is alright, but the second-from-top row is a stretch for it. I would have preferred they curve the pinky column more aggressively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The thumb clusters give only three keys for regular use, but the other three are still comfortable to reach.</strong></p>

    <p>The lower row of thumb keys seems to be intended as the primary one. The upper row requires a small shift of your whole hand to strike fully, though you can graze the innermost upper row key without doing that. The top row is still useful, just for less-frequent keys. The three primary keys are as comfortable as those on the ErgoDox.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>One fewer column on the inner edge is not a problem.</strong></p>

    <p>I liked the big 1.5u keys on the inner columns of the ErgoDox because I could lift my hand and slap them with minimal precision. They were useful for symmetric, rare keys like brackets. The Glove80 takes this away, but since many more keys are reachable with the concavity, you can just bind those keys to the bottommost row, which is the most awkward but still way more reachable than those inner columns were.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The top row is only useful for rarely-used keys.</strong></p>

    <p>It’s too far, except for maybe the middle finger. That’s probably why it defaults to function keys.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="convenience">Convenience</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The wireless inter-keyboard connection is flawless.</strong></p>

    <p>In three months of using the keyboard every day, I have only had the two halves unable to communicate with each other once when I made a mistake while flashing firmware. It just works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Having four Bluetooth connections makes it easy to use my keyboard everywhere.</strong></p>

    <p>I have three computers that I use this keyboard with regularly, so having a dedicated connection for each I can switch between with a single keystroke allows me to use my preferred keyboard with a minimum of fuss. The four-color status indicators are a nice bonus too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Battery life is good but not incredible.</strong></p>

    <p>I’m used to a wired keyboard, so having any battery life to worry about at all is a downgrade. The battery life is measured in weeks, which is long enough to not be a problem but feels short compared to e.g. my mouse, whose battery life is measured in months. I would have preferred a heavier keyboard for unrelated reasons, so adding that weight with a larger battery would have been a win-win in my mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>USB-C yes please.</strong></p>

    <p>No proprietary USB A Logitech dongles, no ErgoDox USB mini-B nonsense (that’s right: <em>not</em> micro-B; do you even remember mini-B?). Everything in my life must be USB-C.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ZMK firmware is a big step up from QMK.</strong></p>

    <p>ZMK was significantly easier for me to pick up and run with than QMK. In particular, it’s much more composable, with a strong macro system that allows combining a library of “behaviors” in infinite ways. ZMK is still under active development but already has all the important core features (up to and including mouse support!), and if you’re already familiar with C it’s clearer how to follow the examples to add custom behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The extra Windows/Linux/Mac/”nerd” keycap sets are a nice touch.</strong></p>

    <p>The manufacturer sells keycaps with the Mac command symbol, Tux the penguin, Vim-style HJKL, etc. As you can see in the picture at the top, I currently use a mish-mash of symbols from different places, which I like. I don’t know how hard it is to find custom keycaps that fit these switches, though the switches themselves seem to be a little hard to find.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The switches are soldered, so make the right choice the first time.</strong></p>

    <p>I think I would have preferred clicky switches, but I can’t change them now with resoldering every single key, which sounds like a recipe for breakage. (Well, more than I already broke it by replacing some keycaps.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The manufacturers are cagey about sharing hardware diagrams despite advertising third-party hardware customizations on the site.</strong></p>

    <p>I wanted to try 3D printing extra-long integrated wrist rests for my large hands, but while I did get a quick response on the manufacturer’s Discord<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> when asking for the necessary measurements to properly line up the screw holes, they clearly did not want to share anything specific nor admit that they didn’t want to share anything specific. It quickly became radio silence.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Glove80 resolves all of the ErgoDox’s issues with bulk, layout and accessories while keeping (or providing slight upgrades to!) most of the ErgoDox’s comfort and customizability features. It’s clearly trying to appeal to both average users and keyboard hackers, which sometimes ends up in tradeoffs favoring the average user, such as portability over big clacky keys. It’s noticeably less robust than the ErgoDox, and may not be as comfortable if you have large hands.</p>

<p>If the Glove80 is under consideration for your first serious ergonomic keyboard, buy it, though note that learning a split, concave and columnar layout without any prior experience takes a while.</p>

<p>If you already have a keyboard collection, this is definitely a worthy addition.</p>

<p>If you’re attracted to mechnical clackfests but want something that won’t give you instant RSI, you might be better of with the ErgoDox or something in that family.</p>

During this review, I was struck by a thought and finally able to articulate why I don’t like Redux:</p>

<p>Redux is a design pattern, not a library.</p>

<p>The core of Redux maps directly onto, and is largely implemented by, language-level features:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>reducers: switch + object spread</li>
  <li>actions: discriminated unions (a language-level feature in TypeScript)</li>
  <li>action creators: object literals/constructors</li>
  <li>middleware: higher-order functions/decorators</li>
  <li>dispatch: function call</li>
  <li>store: just… a plain object</li>
</ul>

<p>Redux-the-library doesn’t actually <em>do</em> anything significant; instead, it merely assigns roles and new names to existing language features. Indeed, when Dan Abramov was still involved in it, one of his frequent selling points was that it was <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367">more of an idea than anything else, and so simple that you could even just implement it yourself</a>…</p>

<p>…which is exactly what you’re supposed to do with a design pattern. Have you ever seen a library for the visitor pattern? No you haven’t, because a design pattern doesn’t have enough meat on the bones to be a library. A design pattern doesn’t save work, abstract away complexity or add expressivity. A design pattern guides you in writing the same amount of code you would have without it, but with fewer traps. That’s Redux-the-library in a nutshell.</p>

<p>It is this misinterpretation of Redux as a library that leads to the overengineered, overabstract boilerplate I associate with the ecosystem of things built upon it. Redux-the-library wraps these expressive language-level constructs into restrictive, supposedly-but-not-really higher-level primitives that other things in the Redux ecosystem attempt to build on. But it doesn’t work: there’s no <em>there</em> there, and most of them (thunks and middlewares and sagas, oh my) also end up being design patterns in disguise, with all the attendant implementation work for their users.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: there is nothing inherently wrong with a library mandating the use of restrictive primitives to interact with it. But this is a cost for using it, and in the case of Redux-the-library, there is no benefit in exchange for this cost, because Redux-the-pattern is too simple for Redux-the-library to offer meaningful expressivity or code savings. I would even say that Redux-the-library is <em>competing</em> with the host language rather than complementing it, replacing usefully context-aware expression of Redux-the-pattern’s ideas with a verbose one-size-fits-all implementation of those ideas.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So much of programming is creating abstractions that operate on higher-level primitives. And while it’s true that by moving your solution one rung higher on the abstraction ladder you can solve a broader swath of related problems, it’s also true that your solution then becomes less expressive and ergonomic in the context from which it was born. This might be okay; finding the correct degree of abstraction is a lot of the art of programming. But if you pursue abstraction for its own sake, you end up writing a programming language inside your programming language or <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/opinion-pieces/bad-carma/">a database schema that can represent any other database schema</a>. The abstraction “collapses”, in a sense, to nothing at all. You end up right where you began, but months later and stuck trying to solve anything other than the original problem in your half-baked non-framework.</p>

      <p>The only core Redux concept missing from this list is selectors, which do not correspond directly to a language-level feature, but “composable memoized pure function implementing a view of a value” is not a novel idea. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Originally this post was just me venting about Redux, but I relegated the remainder of that to this (long) footnote and tried to chop it down a bit. Enjoy an entire bonus post, I guess.</p>

      <p>I suspect a lot of the people involved in the major Redux ecosystem libraries had never heard the phrases “state transition”, “pure function” or “copy on write” before and thought that Redux (both pattern and library) was some kind of generational innovation rather than a textbook example of what those things mean when applied to idiomatic JavaScript. Just another example of web developers rediscovering things that other developers have known for a long time. (n.b. I am also a web developer, I guess.)</p>

      <p>Nobody in the ecosystem seems to notice that the only way to open source any of the abstractions they’ve built in-house is to strip them of all opinions and publish a bunch of wrapper functions or reimplementations of existing language constructs, collectively christened with some new name. After all, you can’t open source <em>your</em> action creators, but you can open source, uh, a function that makes functions that put all their arguments into an object literal.</p>

      <p>The towering momuments to abstraction that inevitably emerge when Redux-the-library is used in nontrivial applications ironically end up being as unpleasant to read and write as what you’d have ended up with if you reached for the first thing that comes to mind <em>without</em> Redux-the-pattern, i.e., a massive, mutable global state singleton. Except: the Redux version is smeared across dozens of files and several libraries. Did you know Dan Abramov <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/dsfio6/comment/f6pmgmj/">never used Redux in any production application</a>? In fact, Dan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/dsfio6/comment/f6p4krr/">really doesn’t like Redux anymore</a>.</p>

      <p>A little tangentially, have you ever seen the types for Redux and Redux-adajacent libraries? I mean, <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/blob/0246f788ef964a6afb5071f5b9a651d48630f3e0/packages/toolkit/src/configureStore.ts#L118-L126">look</a> <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/a128c5ebb30bda6e60d597dc37ab97992f8e0d8d/src/types.ts#L110-L124">at</a> <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/blob/1223a1b0997a6b248ccbac3ba4e2a544a7a676d8/src/createSelectorCreator.ts#L80-L104">these</a>.

It’s a mental health hit-and-run, perpetrated one honk at a time.</p>

<p>Just yesterday I was talking about that utterly ridiculous attempt by BMW to make seat heaters a subscription (which they <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/bmw-relents-on-heated-seat-subscription.html">cancelled</a>, by the way, so don’t worry).</p>

<p>Then it hit me: what if there was a subscription model for honking? Like car insurance, a honking subscription would be compulsory, and in order to have the desired effect, it would be pay-per-use. There’s a ton of variations and angles here.</p>

<p>One Very Important Detail for the plan is the payment method: you could only pay in person with cash or check, perhaps at the local DMV or USPS, and you have to do it once a month. If you’re going to be obnoxious and petty, the system is going to be obnoxious and petty back. As a bonus, this also ensures that rich people can’t pay their way out of being dicks.</p>

<p>I know you have questions. I have answered all of them below.</p>

<h2 id="compulsory-honking-usage-fee-faq">Compulsory Honking Usage Fee FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>How would you keep people from working around the car counting honks?</strong> The same way BMW was going to make sure people paid for seat heaters. I’m sure you could hack around it, but I’ll take a 99% compliance rate any day of the week.</p>

<p><strong>Wouldn’t this end up as a regressive tax on the poor?</strong> I guess technically, but if the goal is to inconvenience people more than make them pay, you can put a really low cap on it. Like $5/month low. We don’t want people’s cars getting repossessed over this.</p>

<p><strong>What if someone didn’t pay?</strong> A fine, proportional to your income, like the way Sweden does speeding tickets. Again, don’t want rich people to pay their way out.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do to prevent people from going hog wild on the horn after they reach the monthly cap?</strong> Unfortunately, nothing. It won’t be worse than now, except when you hear it you know that person is going to have to stand in line at the DMV for hours later this month.</p>

<p><strong>What if you only honk a really tiny amount, like once a month?</strong> Everyone gets some freebies every month, which also protects against inadvertent honking. Like the compliance rate, the goal here is masssive reduction, not total elimination.</p>

<p><strong>Won’t people think twice before using their horn for safety?</strong> What safety? Maybe you get a permit, like a parking permit, for X honks/day if you live near a registered blind curve. (Unexpected side effect: people remove safety features of blind curves to make them eligible for the permit.)</p>

<p><strong>What if someone just leans on the horn for a really long time, so it’s only one count?</strong> You could add a honk count for every, say, 1 full second the horn is held down. With a low monthly cap, the point of the count is to get the gist of the severity. It’s not a thorough audit. They’ll definitely still exhaust their freebies this way.</p>

<p><strong>What about all the bureaucracy this would create?</strong> Maybe the program would pay for itself. It’s not exactly intended to be a for-profit endeavour. Alternately: it wouldn’t be the first time the government pays out to <em>stop</em> people from doing something. And this way, we would get peace and quiet instead of, uh, less corn, or soybeans, or whatever.</p>

It’s a mental health hit-and-run, perpetrated one honk at a time.]]></summary></entry></feed>

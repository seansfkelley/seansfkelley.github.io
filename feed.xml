Scales up or down indefinitely.</p>

<p>In addition to the ingredients, you’ll need one or more containers equalling the volume of milk you use, an ice bath, and a sous vide machine (or a few towels).</p>

<p>If you use a sous vide machine, this recipe will require about 4 hours of fermentation. Make sure the containers are tall enough or seal tightly enough that they will not leak into the bath.</p>

<p>If you do not use a sous vide machine, the recipe will probably require more than 4 hours of fermentation, and the final product will likely be thinner. You may also want to start the fermentation <span class="unit metric">3°C</span><span class="unit imperial">5°F</span> hotter, to keep the yogurt cultures in their preferred temperature range for longer (but not too hot!).</p>

<p>You can reculture some store-bought yogurts, as long as they specify they have live cultures, which you can find in both cheap and expensive yogurts.</p>

<hr />

<p>Heat</p>

<ul>
  <li>½ gallon whole milk</li>
</ul>

<p>in a pot over medium heat until it reaches <span class="unit metric">95°C</span><span class="unit imperial">200°F</span>, stirring frequently to minimize scalding, and skimming off the skin as necessary.</p>

<p>Prepare an ice bath for the milk. Chill, stirring frequently to ensure even cooling, until it reaches <span class="unit metric">45°C</span><span class="unit imperial">110°F</span>.</p>

<p>Add</p>

<ul>
  <li>½ cup yogurt</li>
</ul>

<p>to a small bowl. Spoon approximately ¼ cup of milk into the yogurt, stirring to combine, then repeat a couple more times until the yogurt is warmed and diluted.</p>

<p>Pour the yogurt mixture back into the milk pot, and stir thoroughly.</p>

<p>If you’re using a sous vide machine, set it to <span class="unit metric">45°C</span><span class="unit imperial">110°F</span>. Divide the milk mixture into your containers, and put them in the sous vide bath. Sous vide for 4 hours.</p>

<p>If you are not using a sous vide machine, leave the milk mixture in the pot and wrap it completely with towels. Set it in a warm place in the kitchen for at least 4 hours.</p>

<p>The yogurt is done when it reaches your desired consistency and tartness. Longer fermentations will thicken the yogurt (to a limit) and make it more tart. Remember that cold yogurt is thicker! If you want to make Greek yogurt, strain through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer until your desired consistency is reached.</p>

I referenced two guides:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://timberbiscuitwoodworks.com/blog/how-to-ebonize-wood">Timber Biscuit Woodworks</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/finishing/ebonizing_wood/">Popular Woodworking</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Both are good, but the former felt easier to follow to me. Here are my notes:</p>

<p>Two cups of distilled white vinegar and half a pad of #0000 steel wool took two weeks to stop reacting and settle on a color remarkably like black tea (after I strained it out). I should have started earlier. It’s possible that more iron would make a solution that performs “better” in some fashion, but I didn’t try.</p>

<p>Yes, spring for the quebracho powder/extract. I bought <a href="https://www.vandykestaxidermy.com/BKT2-P3850.aspx">the one from Van Dyke’s</a> one of the guides linked, which was about $30 all-in. (They have a weird shipping-cost policy… it is not $0 as it appears.) Despite supposedly being one of the more tannic woods, my white oak turned at best a pallid grey without help. I also tried oversteeping cheap black tea to make an undrinkably astringent (i.e. tannic) brew before using the bark extract, but it barely made a difference.</p>

<p>The ebonized layer is thin and the ebonizing solutions themselves are water-thin, so plan your glue-up/sanding/finishing accordingly. I would not recommend more than burnishing or fine steel wool once the ebonizing is done. If you’re doing ebonized accent pieces, you may need to do your sanding/glue-up out of order to avoid accidentally ebonizing adjacent wood, because the solutions <em>will</em> bleed.</p>

<p>Make sure you get into the deep grain, if your chosen wood has it. My first pieces had a lot of completely un-ebonized white grain streaks, which looked bad. I didn’t do any formal side-by-side testing, but some combination of (1) two coats (of each solution, alternating), (2) using steel wool to lightly rub in the iron solution and (3) a drop of dish soap to break the surface tension allowed me to get a consistent black throughout on white oak. Guide #1 above recommends also sanding and then repeating the whole process, but I didn’t try that. (Maybe next time I’ll try those three separately and see which actually helps.)</p>

<p>Use a squirt bottle or pour the solutions into cups/trays. Because this finish is two-part, you don’t want to get one part into the other! All of your applicators will turn the same dark grey/black by the time you’re done, which you don’t want to happen to your entire supply of the solutions.</p>

<p>You may end up with a slightly splotchy dark grey, but once you put the final finish on the workpiece it should all turn a deep, even black. Check out the pictures below.</p>

<p><strong>Test, test, test!</strong> Variances in wood, application technique, brewing up the solution… there’s a lot of variables which you don’t want to learn about the hard way on your almost-finished workpiece.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here’s a few pictures from the process.</p>

You can see on the second from the bottom that the end grain is much more consistent and receptive, but on the face grain the color is at best a medium grey.

That way people know what you’re talking about. Second things second: it’s “whisky”, not “whiskey”.</p>

<p>At the time of writing it’s been four years since I went to Edinburgh, so the list has slimmed down quite a bit from what it might have been due to cognitive attrition. Anyway, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.rabbies.com/en-us/tour/loch-ness-inverness-the-highlands-2-day-tour-from-edinburgh">Rabbie’s overnight Highlands tour</a>:</strong> got a great whirlwind tour hitting Inverness, Ben Nevin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden">Culloden</a>, <a href="https://www.duncarronmedievalvillage.com/">Duncarron</a>, and the largest full Scottish breakfast I’ve ever seen (at a real bed and breakfast)! Ask me about coracles sometime.</li>
  <li><strong>Teutchers Landing:</strong> lovely local pub in an amusingly cobbled-together building and a great selection of scotches.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://smws.com/venues/28-queen-street-edinburgh">Scotch Malt Whisky Society (Queen Street)</a>:</strong> their whole thing is you order whisky based purely on the tasting notes – they will not tell you what distillery or whisky it is. Love it.</li>
  <li><strong>Auchentoshan:</strong> okay this is actually in Glasgow, but the train ride is quick because Edinburgh and Glasgow are a conurbation and it’s the nearest notable distillery and offers tours. The tours are great and come with a really interesting tasting at the end.</li>
  <li><strong>Arthur’s Seat:</strong> a mild hike located right in the city with nice views. Great for sunset.</li>
  <li><strong>Haggis:</strong> the weirdness of haggis is way overblown. I think Americans are just afraid of off-cuts. If anything, it’s actually kind of boring – but give it a try anyway just to know.</li>
  <li><strong>Cullen skink:</strong> classic dish that’s basically fish chowder. Not bad if you’re into that kind of thing.</li>
  <li><strong>Harry Potter walking tour</strong> (or just Victoria Street and Greyfriars Kirkyard Cemetery): honestly you could just look it up on the internet and do it yourself… even as a mild Harry Potter fan it’s still kind of interesting to see the subtle or not-so-subtle references made to Edinburgh in the book.</li>
  <li><strong>National Museum of Scotland:</strong> Celts, Anglo-Saxons, and a surprising amount of Industrial Revolution (given the size of the country).</li>
  <li><strong>Fringe Festival:</strong> I haven’t gone, but it sounds like a ton of fun. You’ll probably know if you are accidentally going when it’s on because of the prices of everything.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="first-up-pubs">First Up: Pubs</h3>

<p><em>The most important.</em> Ask me for my pub list. (I’ll write a blog post for it eventually.)</p>

<h3 id="second-non-food-things">Second: Non-food Things</h3>

<p>In no particular order.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regent’s canal walk and Thames river walk:</strong> good way to see a bunch of different neighborhoods, and everyone likes water features.</li>
  <li><strong>Portobello Road market:</strong> huge antiques-ish market, with an endless selection of silver in particular.</li>
  <li><strong>Highgate Cemetery:</strong> actually really cool architecture and some interesting history. Very close to Hampstead Heath, which is a particularly nice big park, among all their great big parks.</li>
  <li><strong>Globe Theater:</strong> yeah, touristy, but it’s hard to go wrong with Shakespeare… though there are so many shows to choose from (like The Burnt City, which is the same troupe that did Sleep No More).</li>
  <li><strong>British Museum:</strong> obviously, but specifically, the Sutton Hoo exhibit. Also the Rosetta stone is also just like, right there in the hallway.</li>
  <li><strong>Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A):</strong> ironwork, fashion, plaster casts… it’s interesting and high quality stuff you won’t find in the British Museum.</li>
  <li><strong>London Transport Museum:</strong> if you’re into buses ‘n’ shit. I liked it.</li>
  <li><strong>Parks:</strong> the Brits are good at parks, so if you’re out for a walk, try to route through one of the big ones nearby (there are a lot of those).</li>
  <li><strong>Literally any historic tour:</strong> I did Parliament, the Tower of London, and Hampton Court, all of which were a good time, especially the first one.</li>
  <li><strong>Sunset drinks:</strong> the Shard and the Walkie Talkie have sunset drinks on their top floors.</li>
  <li><strong>St Pancras station</strong> (just if you’re nearby): it’s reaaaally pretty, and King’s Cross is not, which is why the Harry Potter movies lied and used it for filming instead of the real King’s Cross.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="third-food-things">Third: Food Things</h3>

<p>Please note that I am not a Restaurant Person. London is like NYC or LA in this domain – they have literally everything, somewhere, and it’s good. You could very well just find a listicle and not be led too far astray.</p>

<p>Also, British food isn’t as bad as people make it out to be, mostly because they’ve figured out how to make it better and also because <em>you have to expect the right thing</em> – all British food is, basically, fall/winter comfort food. They don’t eat fresh things.</p>

<p>Anyway:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SUNDAY ROAST:</strong> yes, it’s actually only available on Sundays, and yes, you have to go to a pub to eat it, but no, you don’t even have to order a pint. Check the pub list for recommendations.</li>
  <li><strong>Borough Market:</strong>  a little touristy, but lots of good food choices (including a guy who sells straight sea urchin that I went to several times).</li>
  <li>Postcard Teas: small, fancy tea store with curated and actually interesting collection of teas, plus tastings (though sign up way in advance if you want to do that).</li>
  <li><strong>Bone Daddies:</strong> ramen, in particular, the dipping ramen which I’ve never seen anywhere else, and the Soho one is the original.</li>
  <li><strong>Pick &amp; Cheese:</strong> sushi belt cheese. Also nearby the famous Neal’s Yard Dairy so you can just… buy cheese. To eat.</li>
  <li><strong>Dishoom:</strong> the Indian restaurant on every “best Indian in London” list. It is good, though.</li>
  <li><strong>Lahore Kebab House:</strong> recommended by Meera Sodha in <a href="https://msmarmitelover.com/2017/01/in-conversation-with-meera-sodha-andre.html">this interview</a> (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210801031009/http://meerasodha.com/where-to-eat/uk/">previously on her site</a>). Was excellently delicious, but the next day was not so great.</li>
  <li><strong>Gunpowder:</strong> also recommended by Meera Sodha. Trendy and and a little fusion-y.</li>
  <li><strong>Abeno:</strong> okonomiyaki/teppanyaki place right next to the British Museum.</li>
  <li><strong>Savory pie,</strong> in general: the one I would have recommended had the chef die (!) while I was there last. (I don’t know if this is the same thing as a hand pie.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="last-and-certainly-least-anti-recommendations">Last and Certainly Least: Anti-recommendations</h3>

<p>Don’t do these.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Battersea:</strong> the hip new converted-coal-power-plant-development thing. It’s just a mall, though the building itself is really impressive. You can get a similar effect from the Tate Modern, also an ex-power-plant, which is more worth seeing (if you like modern art).</li>
  <li><strong>Changing of the guard:</strong> it’s just some dudes in silly hats marching around. I wouldn’t even bother taking a look at Buckingham Palace unless you’re in the area, since it’s just another European king’s house which are all rather same-y.</li>
  <li><strong>Camden Market:</strong> probably cooler in the past, but mostly just an outdoor punk-hipster mall.</li>
  <li>Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus: just straight-up tourist traps.</li>
</ul>

If you’re here, I probably sent you because you nagged me to play Commander. But I don’t like Commander, and here’s why.</p>

<p><strong>The board states are massively overcomplicated.</strong> I <em>do</em> like intricate multi-hour Euro games, but that’s not the itch that Magic scratches for me. I think Magic is at its best when games are quick and spunky and where the opponents bring clearly-distinct styles, like tennis. The ~400 unique cards in a Commander game dramatically amplify the complexity that Wizards keeps adding<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> when compared to the ~40 unique cards in a Constructed game.</p>

<p><strong>Games quickly become crude, swingy slugfests.</strong> Board wipes followed by dumping huge sorceries (or whatever). Lurching between different piles of cards is inelegant and loses out on all the fun subtleties in navigating a well-built deck between your opponent’s swings to land a fatal blow. Hitting your curve perfectly and outracing your opponent with 3 life remaining is much more rewarding than crushing them with an overwhelming force of eleven 9/9 tramplers while you sit at 39 life.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t like politicking and managing social dynamics.</strong> In Commander, I avoid knocking someone out of a game early even if that’s the right strategy because it sucks when that happens to you. You don’t generally have to worry about peoples’ feelings in Constructed. (I also can’t stand Diplomacy.)</p>

<p><strong>Like the much-loathed companion cycle, a commander negatively warps deckbuilding around it.</strong> A lot of decks feel like random in-color cards that are good with the commander and bad without it. Decks with single points of failure (success?) are antithetical to my deckbuilding style, which is also a big part of the reason I don’t like combo decks or tutors.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> I want, and build, decks with lots of little synergies so that there’s always something available, but not the same thing every time.</p>

<p><strong>The decks take a <em>long</em> time to hone.</strong> To be clear, I still spend a lot of time refining my Constructed decks, but you can get a working first draft pretty quickly. In a Constructed deck, substituting even a single playset will often change the feel of a deck noticeably in a way that keeps the feedback loop rewarding and lets you explore more adjacent playstyles without being held back by the required interactions with (or color restrictions of) the commander.</p>

<p><strong>Old cards are ugly.</strong> There, I said it. (To be fair, a lot of new card frames are ugly too. At least the old cards are not near-impossible to read. But I’d rather have neither.)</p>

<p>Last time I tried to build a Commander deck, I ended up throwing out the 80% of it that was chaff, and kept the 20% that was fun. And then I put in 4 copies of each card. Oops.</p>

      <p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with increasing the complexity of the game, if it’s done tastefully. But recently Wizards has started adding a lot of state to manage, some of which doesn’t have a good physical representation. Exert is one such mechanic (how many times I have accidentally untapped an exerted thing…), and good luck remembering the 4,000 different types of behaviors available to cards in exile depending on how they got there. All of this before we even get to Wizards printing new sets at <em>breakneck</em> speed with some straight-up shitty mechanics, then having the gall to “reprint” the set <em>while it’s being printed for the first time</em> because Daddy Hasbro is too cheap to shell out for all the rights to Spiderman. Fuck you, Hasbro. (Note that this should not be taken to mean I would prefer more Spiderman cards. Universes Beyond is fucking awful, and I’ve hamstrung my own decks a few times just to avoid some of the more egregious crossovers.) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>My rule of thumb is that any interaction requiring three cards should be considered pure bonus upside, perhaps shading into win-more, and not required for the deck to work. (Unless one of them is lands, since they are always around.) Three-card interactions are often too fragile to be fun or end up with the deck being a tedious tutor/control/delay shell around those three cards. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can only do this for 3 apps at a time.</li>
  <li>You have to put your phone into “developer mode”, which Apple describes in vaguely threatening language regarding security.</li>
  <li>You need to leave something running on your computer and be on the same network as it at least one a week.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternately, you could just move to the EU or lobby your congressperson to get off their fucking asses and do something useful instead of vomiting something about “innovation” and “small businesses” while sucking off a billionaire.</p>

<h3 id="the-actual-tutorial">The Actual Tutorial</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Install <a href="https://altstore.io/#Downloads">AltServer</a> on your computer and AltStore on your iPhone. <a href="https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/how-to-install-altstore-macos">Details.</a>
    <ul>
      <li>You probably want to enable the AltServer &gt; Launch at Login menu option.</li>
      <li>If you can’t see your phone in Finder after unplugging it, try Apple menu &gt; Force Quit… &gt; Finder &gt; Relaunch.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Build an unsigned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ipa</code> bundle using Xcode (as far as it’s willing to help).
    <ol>
      <li>Product &gt; Archive (in Xcode 16), which should open the Xcode Organizer showing the build.</li>
      <li>Right-click the build and Show in Finder to reveal the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.xcarchive</code>. It’s a directory, so pop it open (right-click &gt; Show Package Contents, or just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>) and find the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Products/Applications</code>.</li>
      <li>Pull the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.app</code> out and plop it in a new empty directory somewhere called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Payload</code>.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zip -r &lt;app&gt;.ipa Payload</code> to finish the unsigned bundle.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Get the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ipa</code> onto your phone somehow.
    <ul>
      <li>Apple makes this really fucking annoying to do through the Files app,<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> so I just used my Dropbox. iCloud Drive (and other similar things) probably also work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In AltStore, go to My Apps &gt; + &gt; navigate to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ipa</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>Note that it starts you down a directory – hit the back button to see other file systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That should be it! You can test the wireless refreshing by tapping “7 Days” in the newly-installed app listing.</p>

I think the problem is that we’re talking past each other: there are different ways to be a bad driver.</p>

<p>I hereby propose a rating system with three axes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>incompetence</strong></li>
  <li><strong>negligence</strong></li>
  <li><strong>aggression</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some example applications for some places I’m familiar with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>NorCal:</strong> incompetent and negligent, but emphatically passive</li>
  <li><strong>Italy:</strong> hyper-aggressive, but by and large competent and usually attentive</li>
  <li><strong>New York City:</strong> all sliders to <em>maximum</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I think disagreements happen when your bad drivers and their bad drivers are at even moderately-different positions along these axes.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while it’s obvious that minimal incompetence and minimal negligence is objectively good, the same is not true for aggression. Drivers that are too passive cause traffic flow problems and annoy other drivers – rightfully, I’d say, if you won’t pull into the intersection on green when you’re waiting to turn left.</p>

The process is tedious, it’s difficult to understand how well it’s working, and I sometimes wonder if it’s worth it, since credit bureaus and insurance companies are basically handing out your PII to hackers.</p>

<p>I persist because it buys me peace of mind and because I’m too principled to concede the point. I try to be somewhat pragmatic about it, and there are instances where I trade privacy for convenience. This makes Google a particularly thorny case, since I value the services they provide – unlike Facebook, which I left years ago and often forget still exists.</p>

<p>This post outlines my de-Googling strategy.</p>

<h2 id="search--kagi">Search → <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a></h2>

<p>Yes: I pay for my search engine. It turns out that if you drink zero cups of coffee a day, the “cheaper than a cup of coffee” marketing play works. In fact… it works better? I have a larger budget for coffee-priced things.</p>

<p>For a long time I used <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> (and I still use it when I’m on someone else’s computer or I can’t be bothered to set up my Kagi account on a device), but I found the quality of the search results barely better than Google, which itself has undergone a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+search+results+are+getting+worse">well-documented decline</a>. Perhaps this is because they’re both advertising-driven, so their incentives aren’t totally aligned with their users.</p>

<p>Kagi, being a pay-for service, only makes money if it serves users’ needs. Imagine that! They churn out features like crazy, including a <em>lot</em> to customize your search results, as well as a bunch of random other services I couldn’t really care less about. It’s really lovely to be able to uprank/downrank sites.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Admittedly, the vast majority of my searches are pretty simplistic,<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> usually ending on Wikipedia, StackOverflow, IMDb… so the bar isn’t terribly high. I occasionally dip back into Google with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!g</code> (<a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html">bangs</a> are a feature they totally stole from DuckDuckGo), but 100% of the time I find the same bad results, so I should really stop bothering.</p>

<h2 id="chrome--firefox">Chrome → <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a></h2>

<p>It’s the same. You’ll be fine, trust me. Using Firefox is like driving a Saab – a <em>perfectly suitable tool</em> for your needs, but because it died out and nobody sees it anymore, you get looks and people assume you’re weird and/or totally out of touch.</p>

<p>I switched to Chrome like everybody else back in the 2010s when it was the hot new thing and Firefox was dog slow, but even though Firefox itself hasn’t <em>quite</em> kept pace (though <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/">the big change in 2017</a> really made a huge difference), computers and connections have gotten faster so it’s not noticeable in real life. What is noticeable is Chrome sucking up all my memory and <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome/">normalizing stalker-ish behavior</a> (which they later <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/product-updates-based-your-feedback/">backpedaled on</a>, sort of).</p>

<h2 id="gmail--fastmail">Gmail → <a href="https://fastmail.com">Fastmail</a></h2>

<p>This was the big one. I spent months hemming and hawing on whether I wanted to uproot my entire online identity and replace it with another one. I finally did sometime in 2020, and it’s been… uneventful. The world did not come crumbling down around me, though I’m still in the process of shifting accounts over to the new address. The old account will necessarily have to live forever – it’s in too many places, some of which don’t allow me to change it.</p>

<p>The biggest uncertainty was Fastmail’s quality of spam filtering. Five years later, I can say: perfectly fine. I can recall two incidents where things I needed were erroneously flagged as spam, and one where spam made it to my inbox.</p>

<p>A component of my strategy here involves heavy usage of the masked email addresses. Only real people and important services (or those with KYC protocols, like banks and airlines) get a real email address. This is annoying to enforce and admittedly has not really yielded many benefits, but I’ll keep doing it for peace of mind. I am legitimately surprised at how few companies seem to actually sell my masked email addresses to spammers.</p>

<p>I decided against <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a> because I’m willing to trade off a lack of end-to-end encryption for the convenience of being able to use any client I want anywhere and have it just work. That is, after all, the magic of federated protocols!</p>

<h2 id="maps--apple-maps">Maps → <a href="https://maps.apple.com/">Apple Maps</a></h2>

<p>(With apologies to non-Mac, non-iPhone users.)</p>

<p>Apple Maps used to suck. Like, really bad. It’s improved dramatically in the years since its release, and the only things I ever return to Google Maps for are to check suspicious-looking opening hours, which are <em>occasionally</em> wrong in Apple Maps.</p>

<p>This particular transition has been so successful that whenever I do end up in Google Maps, I find it an overwhelming and unpleasant place to be. The interface is laggy, packed with ads, and bombards you with buttons and completely useless location pins apparently pulled out of a hat. Why??<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Apple Maps is refreshingly direct and crisp, and really only shows you information you ask for.</p>

<p>That said: the search, um, leaves something to be desired. Thankfully, like with Kagi, my search needs are pretty basic – find things by their name, or just the word “gas” – so it gets the job done. Also, I don’t use any of the Yelp-like or custom map/pin features of Google Maps, of which Apple Maps doesn’t have a lot. I use Yelp.</p>

<h2 id="youtube--nebula-max-infuse-and-youtube">YouTube → <a href="https://watchnebula.com/">Nebula</a>, <a href="https://www.max.com/">Max</a>, <a href="https://firecore.com/">Infuse</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a></h2>

<p>Okay, this one is basically impossible to get rid of. It so happens that I subscribe to a lot of channels that are also on Nebula, which I gladly pay $3/month for. I only ever watch YouTube on an Apple TV, so I gave it its own Google account to keep it away from the remains of my real one.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Thankfully, since YouTube is just glorified television, the privacy risk seems minimal. To me, it’s more important to be able to pay to get rid of the ads <em>and</em> have that pay go towards (usually) higher-quality content instead of all the clickbait garbage on YouTube.</p>

<h2 id="drive-docs-sheets--icloud-drive-apple-pages-apple-numbers">Drive, Docs, Sheets… → <a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/">iCloud Drive</a>, Apple Pages, Apple Numbers…</h2>

<p>(With more apologies to non-Mac, non-iPhone users.)</p>

<p>I barely use any of these, so this was an easy transition to make.</p>

<p>I have one primary computer, with backups, so I don’t see much upside to keeping things on Drive. As a programmer, I use my text editor for almost all text-based work, writing maybe one “document” a year. Spreadsheets are usually one-off a couple times a year, so Numbers’ mediocre (but much prettier!) reimplementation of Excel is perfectly serviceable.</p>

<p>I recently started using iCloud Drive for a bunch of shared documents, which was an option available to me, but I only chose it over <a href="https://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> because Dropbox seems like a dying company and the product is really pretty ugly and clunky now.</p>

<h2 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The Elephant in the Room</h2>

<p>Yeah, a lot of what I did was to swap one big tech company for another.</p>

<p>This is a conscious decision I made as part of the convenience/privacy tradeoff. I’m unsure how honest I think Apple’s apparent commitment to privacy is (though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%E2%80%93FBI_encryption_dispute">San Bernadino shooter incident</a> was definitely some good press for them), but since they make money off of hardware and being a services middleman, instead of advertising, it’s much more believeable than the company that <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/google-motto-dont-be-evil/">retracted “don’t be evil” as an unofficial slogan</a>.</p>

<p>With each passing year, the gap between competitors for the commoditized digital products that make up almost this entire list – here meaning primarily Apple, but also sometimes-crappy open source alternatives – closes. If I need to jump ship to OpenStreetMap, I won’t be entirely happy, but it’ll be a lot more usable than it was five years ago.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-do-it-too">You can do it too!</h2>

<p>We’re so conditioned to associate digital convenience and safety with the big names, but that’s an illusion born, I suspect, from sheer ubiquity instead of any unique technical merit. I also think we’re too quick to dismiss something that’s 95% as good as the incumbent because one naturally wants <em>the best</em>. Do you actually use that last 5%? It is worth shipping all your data to Google so that you avoid being misled one time a year about opening hours?</p>

<p>It feels liberating to take back some control over this stuff. For my data to (largely) be my own, insulated from the risk of my online life being smashed underfoot as Google lumbers around locking accounts without recourse because you did one thing that makes you look like a statistical outlier.</p>

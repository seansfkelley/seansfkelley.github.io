  </header><p>Recently I’ve been working through some security debt in my personal accounts. Most notably, until recently I didn’t have a good strategy for recovering access in the case of a disaster where all my devices were lost or destroyed.</p>

<p>As part of my strategy/system, I decided it would be prudent to memorize more than just my master password for my password manager. However, I use long-lived login sessions for several of the most important accounts, meaning I don’t have a natural opportunity to memorize their passwords.</p>

<p>As a password memorization aid (and to brush up on my Rust), I wrote <a href="https://github.com/seansfkelley/passprompt">passprompt</a>, which is a little terminal program to nag oneself to enter passwords periodically. I’ve configured it to run on new terminal prompts, but not more than once an hour. This way, as I naturally spend a couple hours here and a couple hours there working on my personal programming projects, I also pay down my security debt by keeping certain passwords fresh.</p>

        This filthy trick makes sure that the content always weakly tries to expand to the full
        width available, but allows for linebreaks if the viewport is too small. It produces a
        better result than, say, width: 100%; or width: some-fixed-pixel-amount; and doesn't require
        rewriting everything to flexbox (which would mess with the <html>-level scroll behavior and
        sticky header) or adding extra DOM (which I'm trying to minimize to make myself feel good).

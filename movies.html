<p><strong>In general, I don’t recommend watching trailers for any movies.</strong> If you’re here for my recommendations, try to triangulate if you’ll like it from my one-liners or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_line">log line</a> on IMDb. It’s always more fun to go in without expectations (and without spoilers).</p>

          <p>Much less cutesy and more actually touching than I expected. It was also very visually pretty, and a bit too slow.</p>

          <p>I liked that the core narrative gimmick was kind of ill-defined and blended several things – supernatural happenings, time travel, body-switching – because the rules weren’t important and it made for some interesting scenes and unexpected plot turns.</p>

          <p>I would have much preferred a melancholy ending where he never meets her again and we wonder if the girl on the bridge was her or someone else with a red ribbon.</p>

          <p>Very. Strong. The Last of Us. Energy. I like a zombie movie that takes itself seriously.</p>

          <p>This movie had some seriously fresh takes on the genre, as well as some unique scenes. Second-generation zombies as symbiotes adds a whole dimension of competing motivations. I have only ever seen a scene walking through a crowd of zombies in Shaun of the Dead – this is hard to make believable! Melanie was very clever and well-acted.</p>

          <p>The ending was pretty cheesy, though I appreciated the role reversal of lessons-in-a-tiny-box from the beginning of the movie. Still, I would rather have her just released the spores for everyone and been done with it. I also didn’t particularly like the feral children, and they only really became “necessary” to fill out the class at the end.</p>

          <p>Like The Cell, this movie was also heavy on the pretty. It has a much more compelling plot, the foreshadowing for which is, in retrospect, pretty obvious. Still, I like that there was a little flourish at the end with the reveal that the whole thing was about stunt men: admittedly I was too distracted to figure that out ahead of time, and it elevated the whole plot.</p>

          <p>I <em>loved</em> the way this movie worked the girl’s questions into the story. Watching the characters react as Lee Pace adjusts the narrative on the fly was fun and novel, and the transition between his narration and letting the characters speak was very smooth so the interruptions weren’t jarring.</p>

          <p>I love that this movie dumps this ridiculous premise in your lap right at the beginning, and then relentlessly follows through. There is never a break from the strangeness: no characters or worldbuilding are at all recognizable and the plot just keeps pushing. The movie establishes this very early so you aren’t completely blindsided, and the pacing does an execellent job meting out revelations and reactions to keep the strangeness fresh.</p>

          <p>The premise was neat and the cinematography was <em>excellent</em>, but it was largely repetitive, the softcore porn and gore were both way beyond what was necessary to demonstrate the point and the social commentary was so simplistic and heavyhanded that it was like bad satire.</p>

          <p>The long-delayed ending highlighted the flaws: a strong hint at a twist that was immediately rescinded (why were they applauding the monster walking down the hallway?), wildly incongruous 70s-style gore, and a general violation of the established rules of the universe. It would have played <em>much</em> better if they’d cut to black as she was injecting the activator for the second time, then let you speculate.</p>

          <p>All that said, I loved a lot of the shots (in particular the early one at the urinal) and thought it was clever how they made an ASMR horror movie (so you can’t just shut your eyes!) with very, very little dialogue.</p>

          <p>No pulled punches with this ending! The snow-is-melting foreshadowing had me dreading some Hollywood garbage.</p>

          <p>The Brave New World angle is far too heavyhanded to take seriously, which allows one to focus on the absurdity and visuals, like the tunnel fight scene (hi, Oldboy), the sushi scene, the school scene and also the whole rest of the movie.</p>

          <p>Two glaring and unnecessary distractions that could have been avoided: the undead henchman (why?) and the “clairvoyance” (could have just said “good at hearing”). Also, what’s the deal with the fish scene?</p>

          <p>I wanted to like this movie based on the premise, but I just couldn’t get over the fact that it was 90 minutes of selfish people acting irrationally. I spent the whole movie being pissed off at how awful and, worse, stupid, everybody was.</p>

          <p>This was like a Black Mirror episode, but without any cleverness or depth to the commentary. Or like The Office, but not really funny. In short: stressful but without a reward. The whole thing ends with a whimper.</p>

          <p>I didn’t appreciate the in-your-face Gen Z social media commentary near the end: yeah, we get that the reference was internet lynch mobs. It served no narrative or explanatory purpose and was just a triggering cheap shot out of left field.</p>

          <p>This movie has all the trappings of yet another mass-manufactured superhero movie, but is constantly missing the mark on why people like those: the dialogue is stilted, the CG is bad, the costumes are off the shelf, the pacing is all over the place, and the characters think they have charisma when they don’t.</p>

          <p>This movie also has all the things that make those superhero movies bad too: they swing violently between shoving exposition down your throat or not bothering to explain anything at all, the universe is obviously created just to make sequels and spinoffs, and the whole thing is absolutely never-ending.</p>

          <p>I can’t resist quoting someone else’s review: “the cinematic equivalent of clickbait”. Spot on.</p>

          <p>This is “horror” in the way that Requiem for a Dream is horror. It’s like being in a trance: more of a state of being than a narrative.</p>

          <p>At first I thought it was poor casting to have two clearly 30-year-olds playing high schoolers, but I think now that was an attempt to disorient the viewer.</p>

          <p>The commentary that Hollywood is heartless and exploitative is nothing new, and was done in a more interesting way in the <a href="#joan-is-awful-2023">preceding episode</a> already. The American girl was selfish and oblivious, which I assume was intentional on the writers’ part, but I still quickly came to dread all the scenes she was in.</p>

          <p>I should credit this episode which clarifying to me why I hate true crime as a genre, but I would not recommend watching it just to find that out.</p>

          <p>For an episode that repeats several times how beautiful Scotland is, they really ruined some shots with that gigantic branded rental van sitting there like a billboard. They also mention Netflix by name but bring back Streamberry, which muddles the message and isn’t used nearly as effectively as the previous episode.</p>

          <p>This movie was surprisingly apolitical, in the sense that it didn’t choose a side (left/right) and stuck to merely anti-establishment.</p>

          <p>For the first two thirds of the movie I kept thinking about The Last of Us, which is telling because I think post-apocalyptic movies are only way we see the US looking anything like this. It’s an effective translation of what it means to be war-torn for a country that hasn’t taken it for 150 years, but loves to dish it out.</p>

          <p>The tense moments were sometimes undermined by the poor decision-making that led there (i.e. any time a journalist died). Why didn’t they bring a medical kit in that huge car if they were heading into a warzone?</p>

          <p>The trailers for this movie made it seem like trash, and I only watched it because I saw it was A24. Don’t watch trailers.</p>

          <p>I asked ChatGPT to write me a synopsis for “star-studded revenge action movie with explosions and snappy dialogue on the Shinkansen”. It gave me a movie with a Russian “criminal mastermind”, a wise Japanese father figure, a former special ops agent with “a penchant for trouble” and of course Idris Elba as wildcard. Yup, basically nailed it.</p>

          <p>In addition to the regurgitated non-plot there was just too much overdone CGI, too many cutesy/predictable/unoriginal comedic moments, too many cloyingly one-dimensional characters, too many cameos, and way too much brazen product placement.</p>

          <p>The coddling of the audience (nobody’s <em>really</em> dead!) was tiresome. The <del>water bottle montage</del> Fiji advertisement was unfortunately the best part of the movie.</p>

          <p>This episode was definitely saved by its ending. For the first three quarters I was put off by the obviously-too-obvious Netflix doppelganger, the weird fawning over Salma Hayek and the “quantum computers explain everything” plot justification.</p>

          <p>Then suddenly: <em>I am in this universe</em> because I am watching Streamberry, Salma Hayek is playing herself but as would be written for a TV show, and quantum computers are an acceptable plot device where multiverses are involved. Bam!</p>

          <p>This is cleverly pragmatic storywriting too, because they can pawn off plot holes (i.e., that’s <em>definitely</em> not an enforceable contract) as being part of the worldbuilding from inside the TV episode.</p>

          <p>At first I was complimentary to Netflix for letting such an episode be made, but now I worry that they are so embedded in the culture that they can point out “lol we intentionally make TV to keep you selfish and addicted” and everyone will just laugh it off.</p>

          <p>The feel of the movie is very A24, <a href="#saint-maud-2019">Saint Maud</a>-ish, due to the camerawork, editing and pacing. They like the “atmospheric” thing coupled with mostly-unsubtle visual metaphors/references/hints, with a bit of reading between the lines.</p>

          <p>The tension in this episode came from all the wrong places. Usually, Black Mirror episodes crank up the tension either by subjecting the characters to stresses until they break, or giving them time to realize their situation and take action. This episode had all the typical shallow pressures from crappy action movies, up to and including a car chase. It cheapens the plot.</p>

          <p>The “resurrection by technology” idea has been explored in several other Black Mirror episodes to much greater effect.</p>

          <p>I did really like the reveal at the end, where it turned out the pop song was just NIN in disguise. Miley Cyrus even released her version under the name Ashley O!</p>

          <p>The director said he was inspired after watching Inglorious Basterds, which you can really see in the increasing shamelessness and detachment from reality. Very fun, but like Inglorious Basterds, you have to roll with it (which took me about an hour into the movie to do).</p>

          <p>This is the first <del>Bollywood</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_cinema">Tollywood</a> movie I’ve seen in some time, so while I expected the dance numbers, I was was not prepared for the blunt exposition and saturated/airbrushed appearance of the entire movie. The writing and delivery of the British characters was quite poor, but I suppose that’s because nobody gives a damn about what they have to say. I hope the Telugu was better, though some of the translations of the song lyrics were doing a whole lot of telling and not a lot of showing. Also, that friendship montage was incredible: borderline gay romance territory.</p>

          <p>By the way, their appearance at the end of the movie is apparently an explicit reference to their iconography in the culture. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluri_Sitarama_Raju">bow and arrow</a> was not just for show.</p>

          <p>It’s fun. Moviemaking-wise, my favorite aspect was the mirrored plotlines and the four girls being body doubles of sorts (especially since three of the four in the second half were playing stuntwomen). It was a bit slow at times.</p>

          <p>I figure that B movies like this peaked in the 70s, and nothing about the movie definitively identifies it as <em>not</em> being in the 70s save for the clothing… until the cell phone comes out and they mention Lindsey Lohan. That was surprising and an unfortunately unnecessary dating of the movie since both details were irrelevant to the plot, but maybe that’s the point? Do slasher movies date themselves awkwardly like that?</p>

          <p>“Eco-terrorism” has always felt like an extreme label broadly applied to any type of direct action, and I like that a movie like this can be made to explore one possible end state of groups like Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion.</p>

          <p>Yes, it is a bit preachy, but it’s largely believable, with some allowances: Logan’s tire-slashing/gunfire-dodging agility; Rowan’s conning of the FBI; the physics of shutting off an oil pipeline; the economic/social/racial diversity of the small group. It’s also definitely a bit cathartic, which might mean that it contributes to apathy regarding climate change. Think on that.</p>

          <p>I think that this movie can also be considered a translation for us moderns of why, say, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground">Weather Underground</a> emerged: their issues were similarly pressing as climate change is to us now.</p>

          <p>This show leaned <em>really</em> heavily into the “Nazi” part of “space Nazis”, which are less compelling than real Nazis. The Designed in California prison subplot was ultimately zero sum (they were looking for him but didn’t know they had him already, and he escaped and ended up alone anyway) and the Peter-Parker-looking Nazi boy scout didn’t do anything the dominatrix in white couldn’t have done by herself.</p>

          <p>I think this could have been a 3/4-episode miniseries that focused on how Mon Mothma and whoever Stellan Skarsgård is supported the storming of the base and how Andor ended up there. (This show definitely rewards those who kept track of every minor character in the main Star Wars plot lines.)</p>

          <p>I would have liked a little more worldbuilding, but that didn’t stop me from watching 10 episodes in two days! The neo-noir thriller elements blended reasonably well into spacefaring mystery-adventure and the heavy-handed social commentary parts, the latter of which thankfully didn’t overbear into preachiness.</p>

          <p>I could only make it through four of ten episodes. Even allowing for it being a character piece the pacing is far too slow, and the out-of-order storytelling is so overdone as to give the impression the writers are arbitrarily withholding information to be hostile (as opposed to, say, putting you in the shoes of a lost/confused character).</p>

          <p>In the Before, why is everyone immediately and absolutely convinced it’s the literal apocalypse? I lived through real-life COVID where there was more fearmongering than here, and people didn’t act like that. It ruins the effect. The show should know better, being made in 2021.</p>

          <p>The sets and especially costumes were fantastic, but not enough to bother watching (unlike, say, <a href="#the-cell-2000">The Cell</a>). I also love the concept of a Mad Max-lite travelling troupe.</p>

          <p>This movie had a whole lot of foreshadowing, but almost all of it was quite subtle, like the cheap sunglasses sitting on the side table in the actor’s house, which were very much not the focus of the scene.</p>

          <p>The final shot with the spider was at first scary, and then very quickly absurd. The spider was scared! I liked that the movie seemed to give you only the minimum about to piece together what happened, kind of like Memento. The final scene was then the rather abrupt challenge: “okay, now you figure it out!”</p>

          <p>I didn’t really get why the whole movie was foggy and yellow. General mood, I guess?</p>

          <p>Casting was great; on screen chemistry between the two main actors was good. The story would plod at times, but I kept coming back for the aesthetics and because there were many individually good scenes, even in the slower episodes.</p>

          <p>For a modern show about a violent era, I thought it was relatively restrained in the use of sex and violence, the latter in particular well-used as a sharp accent when the story needed it.</p>

          <p>This was a good night’s entertainment, well acted and really really tense, but I don’t think it’ll stick with me. The story is straightforward; it’s small and messy and ill-conceived; it’s probably closer than any thriller to how such a feud would play out. But it didn’t get under my skin like, say, Green Room did.</p>

          <p>I consider this movie an object lesson in how guns can make mountains out of molehills. (Even though the first murder they showed was a stabbing, the original one, before the movie started, was a shooting too.) And, I suppose, that revenge is fleeting.</p>

          <p>There was a. lot. of sex in this movie, which I suppose makes sense since Bella is effectively a teenager in an adult’s body for much of it. Taken individually, the sex scenes were amusing, but I was disappointed that they didn’t clearly delineate a single era in Bella’s life, like the black and white era, or the first-foray-into-the-real-world era. They blurred the remainder of the movie together. Not what I expected based on the first half hour.</p>

          <p>I saw a great quote from another review of this movie: just because something is anti-sexist, doesn’t mean it’s feminist. Framing empowerment through prostitution seems fraught, and the madame was more than a little exploitative herself.</p>

          <p>The guy who played Harry Astley was so, so flat in his delivery that I very quickly started to dread him ruining the scenes he was in. Was it intentional? Emma Stone though, she was incredible.</p>

          <p>I really like this movie as a dark, foul-mouthed interpretation of what a Wes Anderson movie could be.</p>

          <p>Most of this movie felt like a meditation on how bad sleep deprivation can get. (Or a toothache.) As it accelerated it became a bit like Requiem for a Dream Lite (Ellen Burstyn’s character), complete with drugs, except in this case the hallucinations (?) were not drug-induced but a real (?) monster.</p>

          <p>In any case, the paranoia and uncertainty in the first half or two thirds were for sure the most compelling psychological horror part, but once the monster started showing up for real I lost interest. I don’t know that it would have been any better if it used the “surprise it’s just mental illness” escape hatch, though it set itself up for that. I thought the role reversal between mother and child was amusing. Almost as amusing as the Home Alone contraptions.</p>

          <p>An effect I liked in particular was right after the possession, when the mom is watching TV: the inability to focus and the quick twitches the camera makes are simple but effective.</p>

          <p>I didn’t know this was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear">King Lear</a> when I sat down to watch it, but even then it was very, very apparent that it was a screen<i>play</i> more than it was a movie. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it does have play-like storytelling in that there is a lot of telling instead of showing.</p>

          <p>The set pieces are absolutely incredible. Lots and lots of horses, yes, but the king wandering out of the burning castle while the armies part to let him pass… yowza. They really built and burned a full-size set for that.</p>

          <p>I don’t think the rise of LLMs has changed my thoughts on this movie one way or the other. Ultimately more plausible, perhaps, but they neither undermine nor support the thesis of the movie. That might be a comment more on LLMs themselves than this movie or AI generally.</p>

          <p>The first half is a legitimately scary movie, even if the snuff films started to get a bit overdone for little added effect. In particular, I like the way they explained away trope-y, spooky sounds with e.g. night terrors, or the way they demonstrated Ethan Hawke wasn’t simply going crazy because other characters corroborated some apparently-supernatural happenings.</p>

          <p>It would have been a <em>significantly</em> better movie if they had held the supernatural reveal until the box of movies reappears in the attic right before the end. You would have spent 95% of the movie scared about a murderous and superhumanly stealthly and methodical stalker, and then, twist, it actually <em>is</em> supernatural and the children get Ringu’d into the home movies.</p>

          <p>I love love love Dune, and think that the movies are an excellent transfer to the screen because they hew so closely to the books at all times.</p>

          <p>This one is a little less exciting for not-already-Dune-fans, and even already-Dune-fans, because it doesn’t get to introduce all the wild world-building and main characters, like the first one did. It’s still absolutely worth rewatching, though probably as part of a marathon.</p>

          <p>I found this movie exhausting. As mentioned above, the characters are comtemptible, the commentary on Gen Z culture superficial and well-trodden, and the decision-making unrealistically awful. The only tolerable non-idiotic character was Lee Pace, and even then, merely tolerable.</p>

          <p>Had I known that the movie did not intend to take itself entirely seriously I would have gone in with different expectations, but I don’t think that would have saved it. The few (in retrospect) genuinely funny lines would have registered as such, instead of coming off as the characters continuing to be obnoxious, but the juice just isn’t worth the squeeze.</p>

          <p>This movie has aged great! By focusing on the insular island culture and minimizing intrusion from the outside, it created an environment frozen in time that focuses on people and interactions, and doesn’t suffer from the “this would be done already if we had cell phones” problem.</p>

          <p>If it didn’t invent all the folk-horror tropes, it certainly solidified them. Christopher Lee is fantastic, and in fact, he has said on several occasions that it was his favorite role. Midsommar owes so, so much to this movie. It’s a tighter, higher-production-value movie, but The Wicker Man’s simpler, more earnest style is a better fit for the “folk” part of “folk-horror”.</p>

          <p>I assume in Japanese the name is a little less clunky. Do they have a single-syllable word for “one cut” so the name’s cadence is closer to Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead or whatever?</p>

          <p>The predictability of this movie really is a shame. The polish is evident and there are a few elements I really liked – using Welsh for speaking in tongues, and especially the visuals in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRU7ni9G3rw">last scene of the film</a> (<strong>warning:</strong> mega spoilers at that link)  – but it’s hard to get invested when the movie is telegraphing fanatical mental illness with all the usual religious iconography.</p>

          <p>Oooof. This was a rough watch, but in a good way. It’s hard to find a good horror movie that doesn’t bother with even <em>suggesting</em> supernatural/religious/psychotic tropery, but these are the ones that truly make you uncomfortable due to their potential to actually maybe really happen.</p>

          <p>I’m generally not a fan of body horror, but I thought they hit the mark with enough to contribute to the feeling the movie was going for without accidentally turning the room they were locked inside into Saw Lite.</p>

          <p>I didn’t like this movie when I first watched it. It felt corny, forced, too far outside the realm of believability but without the rest of the trappings (and benefits) of a more out-there plot.</p>

          <p>But after thinking on it for some time, it’s grown on me, specifically <em>because</em> it’s such an out-there core concept in such mundane trappings. What a strange choice for a representation of… STDs? Sexual assault? Death? It’s chilling how such an innocuous action – literally, following – taken to an extreme becomes so unsettling. Plus, I thought that the characters acted pretty reasonably given the insanity they were subjected to.</p>

          <p>This is what would happen if Hemingway wrote a horror movie. In retrospect I <em>kind of</em> like it, but not because it’s likeable on its face so much as that it’s such a brazenly weird and unapologetic vision of… something. It doesn’t even matter what, it’s just the way that it carries itself. Really, it’s more of an… <em>experience</em>… than a story, but that’s not enough to actually recommend anyone else watch it.</p>

          <p>I was convinced that this movie was about mental illness right up until the very end, but the real explanation is much more fun. (Ari Aster confirmed in an interview that there is no trick. It’s what it says it is.) Just a perfectly balanced movie: freaky but believable people; unsettling but not outright hostile to the audience; a great reveal but not one that feels like a gotcha… And that decapitation scene: the perfect choice. We’ve all thought about it when we stick our hands out the car window.</p>

          <p>This movie feels like a lovely small-scale mashup of Primer and, I suppose, Clue. Or like game of hidden identity, except fun. Minimal props, minimal sets, minimal effects: just a bunch of people as confused as the audience trying to figure things out. I loved the idea that the alternate universes varied wildly from “nobody left the house and has any idea that anything is amiss” to “murder body doubles”. Plus, blackouts are (usually) fun.</p>

          <p>Fun fact: the movie was filmed in a few days in the filmmaker’s house, and he only gave each actor their own parts and only the parts they needed for <em>that day</em> of filming. So they’re as surprised as you are.</p>

          <p>Ghosts are my least favorite kind of scare. They require a lot of suspension of disbelief but usually offer little storytelling oomph in return, often less than pagan gods, or witches, or zombies, or those sorts of things.</p>

          <p>I did like some elements and characters of this film, especially the older couple running the orphanage. The child actors are not bad, though the makeup on the ghost boy sure is. I wanted to like it more than I did, and it still feels a little harsh to recommend not watching it, but I’d pick most other horror movies on this list first, for sure.</p>

          <p>Yes, a thousand times yes, I adored this movie. The core supernatural concept was deliciously unsettling to the point where I almost regretted watching it alone in the dark. Framing the hand as a party drug was, to my knowledge, a unique approach that allowed to characters to behave like realistically risky, smartphone-wielding teenagers.</p>

          <p>The visual effects struck the perfect balance of creepy without going overboard, and the increasingly-unsubtle audio-visual cues of the possessive underworld woman were a nice touch.</p>

          <p>I love the self-imposed challenge of making a horror movie in broad daylight. I think folk horror, or at least, this strain of it, is all about the pacing, and Midsommar absolutely nails the pacing. You can’t come on too quickly, otherwise you’d scare off the characters/audience who are largely pretty reasonable. Midsommar takes its time, but it never stops: the ramp-up is relentlessly steady; every scene just a little more weird than the last until you realize you’re way past your comfort zone and how did we get here?</p>

          <p>This reminded me of The Man From Earth, at least before the killings started, but maybe that’s just because that was the first low-budget chamber piece I saw. I’m surprised at how engaging this format could be: I was glued to the TV the whole time, even though the majority of the movie was just… talking. At a dinner party. I do that all the time on my own!</p>

          <p>This movie did remind me quite a bit of a small-scale Us, but it’s different enough (and that’s potentially spoiler-y enough) that I didn’t mention it in the one-liner.</p>

          <p>What a mind fuck. This is Aronofsky at his finest. The thing that stuck out the most to me was the visual metaphors for euphoria, paranoia and hallucinations. The editing and camerawork for those did an excellent job conveying a <em>feeling</em> that put you in the character’s shoes.</p>

          <p>The parallel storylines showing four different versions of the same idea, and four different ways they can all go horribly wrong (and worse when they play off of each other), weave together into a surprisingly coherent storyline. At least, as coherent as it can be through the drug haze. I didn’t even find the moral of the story too blunt: we all know where this leads, and the movie did all showing and no telling.</p>

          <p>Full disclosure: I was told, and went in expecting, that this was a horror movie. It’s not. It starts out sort of like one, but once they figure out it’s a UFO-alien, it becomes almost like a heist movie where you spend the first two thirds of the movie gathering the team and the equipment and the last third of the movie executing the heist. Which is fine, and kind of an interesting idea when mashed up like this, but I would rather they just did that from the start and made a different movie instead.</p>

          <p>There were some clever storywriting bits in the “heist” section of the movie, for sure, but the rules felt a little arbitrary and the I-guess-horror-related shots of the inside of the UFO-alien felt more gratuitous and irrelevant to the story than anything else.</p>

          <p>You know how you have that band where you love the first album, and you wish they would just do the same thing again? Some bands do, and it turns out that that’s usually just boring. Some bands go the complete opposite direction and lose the plot. But some bands strike that perfect balance. Those are the best.</p>

          <p>Us is like Jordan Peele’s perfect second follow up album to his #1 charting Get Out. It has a very similar feel but otherwise bears no relation. It’s got quite a bit of worldbuilding, and the fantastical bent of it permits the more overtly weird aspects – like the scissors, or the raspy voices – to blend and contribute rather than stick out as awkward. I really liked the raspy voices in particular: how creepy, that you talk so little that you aren’t even sure how to do it properly anymore.</p>

          <p>I loved that the show stayed true to the game. I wanted to like the game-as-story more than I did, but the uncanny valley was too strong for me. Having it done live action and non-interactively (so the pacing and delivery can be perfected) is definitely what the doctor ordered. The casting is excellent all around.</p>

          <p>This show did everything right that the Walking Dead did wrong. The zombies are scarier and used more effectively and convincingly (instead of treated as necessary nuisance for the setting), and the tight focus on only one complex relationship is far more compelling than a glorified soap opera ensemble cast.</p>

          <p>It is worth watching even if you’ve played the game and didn’t have uncnany valley problems with it, if only to relive the game.</p>

<p>So anyway, I rewrote out the jQuery and found a way to serve the script indirectly via GitHub, no dedicated site required. You can paste this into your browser console</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">s</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">script</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>or keep it as a bookmarklet with</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">javascript</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nx">s</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">script</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="nx">s</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/seansfkelley/kathack@v1/kh.js</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">s</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="k">void</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>

        This filthy trick makes sure that the content always weakly tries to expand to the full
        width available, but allows for linebreaks if the viewport is too small. It produces a
        better result than, say, width: 100%; or width: some-fixed-pixel-amount; and doesn't require
        rewriting everything to flexbox (which would mess with the <html>-level scroll behavior and
        sticky header) or adding extra DOM (which I'm trying to minimize to make myself feel good).

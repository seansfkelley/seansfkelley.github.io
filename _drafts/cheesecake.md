1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
1 lb cream cheese
9" springform pan

preheat oven to 325.

beat egg yolks until thick and pale. add sour cream, flour, salt, 3/4 c sugar, vanilla, until blended.add cream cheese and beat until smooth.beat egg white until foamy then gradually beat in last 1/4 c sugar until whites are still and shiny. fold into cream cheese mixture.

spoon into crust. bake about 1 hr. yum.

Some protips:

Drier sour cream is better (Trader Joe's is good for this).

Honey grahams are lighter and sweeter - use more of them (8?). Less sugar in the crust is also a good option (or brown sugar!). Normal grahams are better, though. Honey ones make a mushier crust overall.

Sometimes I drop the sugar from the whites entirely to make a slightly cheesier cake. They're also easier to keep in shape if you don't have to interrupt them with sugar.

Do the sides of the pan first when doing the crust, they're more difficult. It's important to note that the crust is not expected to be high enough to keep the cake from touching the sides of the pan.

Bake about 1 hr, or until it's a nice combination of golden brown and not-too-jiggly. Correct judgement needs practice.

Butter the whole damned pan, that way the cake will peel away while cooling with minimal effort. On a related note, don't throw it right into the fridge as soon as it leaves the oven, and for God's sake, man, eat it COLD.

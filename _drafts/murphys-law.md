title: The Complete List of Everything That Can Go Wrong When Making Building a Table
---

- having to buy more wood than strictly necessary because you need pieces that are impossible for a mill to fuckup
- having the mill fuck up it up anyway by planing the boards thinner than you asked
- by thinning the boards more than you asked they reveal a knot that you were hoping wouldn't make it through to the other side
- joining the boards in an order that reduces their flexibility and requires hours of manual planing to adjust
- the boards start warping
- you wet the boards to control their warping and overshoot
- also when they're wet they start developing black dots that need to be sanded out
- you can only join the boards in a certain orientation because you need to use their relative bowing to counteract each other
- the entire table bows anyway, so you have to buy legs that are strong enough to pull it back into alignment
- putting too much glue in a join and needing to take it off with a card scraper
- putting too little glue and ending up with a hairline crack that needs to be filled
- denting the board by dropping something on it because you don't have a real work table
- using a hot steam iron and fabric to raise the dent, only to leave an iron-shaped light spot on the board
- knot plugs that shear off when planing and need to be drilled back out
- putting too much tung oil on too fast and having it end up textured and weird
- shearing off the jig you use to install threaded inserts and needing to go buy more
- the wood is too hard for threaded inserts to go in at their stated size
- you buy the next larger drill bit without realizing it doesn't fit in the chuck and need to go and buy another drill bit with a reduced shank but they don't sell them at the hardware store
- the threaded inserts are too large and don't leave enough room for error given that you already have to crank them in at very high torque so you buy smaller ones
- you buy all the bolts and nuts you need to install the smaller ones, and then find out that the hex head you're using to crank them in is an in-between size that you don't have and you need to go to the hardware store for the 47th time to get another part

title: The Straw that Broke the Camel's Back
---

Years ago, I broke my social media habits almost completely. The one allowance I gave myself was [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), since it's in a domain I am interested in and is aggressively simple, non-algorithimically-manipulative, and turns over slowly enough that you can't waste _too_ much time on it.

I'd been souring on it recently for a combination of reasons, but this morning I saw [a comment](link) that finally broke the camel's back. The comment was rightfully flagged and made hidden by default, so here's a screenshot.

This comment packs in so much I despise about Hacker News and the modern internet at large into such a tiny space that it's frankly impressive. I think I'm done with Hacker News, and I blocked it on all my devices.[^1] Word-by-word:

> Clickbait[^2]

This is an _ordinary title_. It turns out that you sometimes need to read more than just the title to understand an article. Not everything worth reading can be packed into 140 characters or less.

> antidote

This is so melodramatic. Get a grip.

> please?

False sincerity in an attempt to make this absurd request for someone else to read the article on their behalf superficially acceptable.

The kicker is that the article is purely an interest piece of absolutely no significance whatsoever. If you thought _Blade Runner_ was a weird title, read the article. If you can't be bothered to read the actually pretty unexpected and interesting (and short!) story behind the name, _that's okay_. It's not important information. Asking people to do work for you simply because you're lazy, then couching the request in emotionally-charged terminology to suggest this is a worthwhile, principled objection is disrespectful and intellectually dishonest. Go read a book.

Regardless of your feelings on Hacker News, you might like [this article from the New Yorker]. Choice phrases that I use when Hacker News comes up in conversation are "performative erudition" and "[insert other quote here]".

And now, the mandatory xkcd:

[^1]: On a laptop/desktop, I like blocking in `/etc/hosts`. It's easy to do, but annoying enough to undo that I won't. On iOS, the best option I've found is to enable "Limit Adult Websites" buried deep in Settings, which permits you to specify never-allowed sites. It's clunky, and sometimes triggers false positives when a site has sexy-sounding or sexy-adjacent text/images, but that's rare enough that I deal. It'd be nice if Apple let me block sites _without_ that, but they know best, and doing so would require (\*gasp\*) a fourth option.
[^2]: To be clear, like any well-adjusted person, I hate clickbait headlines. They  are the touchstone for everything that is awful about written media on the internet: advertising-packed regurgitations of shallow, snarky social media comments, repackaged and delivered on once-respectable letterhead (wrong word).

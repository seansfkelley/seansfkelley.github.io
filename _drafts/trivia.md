title: What Makes Good Trivia?
---

I spent several years developing a trivia habit. Or rather, it took several years of me trying out different bar trivias to find the one I want. But I can't go to that one anymore, so I was recently forced to try a new one out. It was perhaps the most un-fun trivia experience I can remember, but the difference between what I had come to love and what I just experienced was large enough that it spurred some thoughts.

In no particular order, here are some opinions on what makes good trivia.

**Scoring entire rounds at once.** This trivia scored (and announced the answer to) each question individually. This meant that there was constant time pressure to keep the trivia on track, which turned it from a semi-structured shit-shooting activity with friends into a full-on exam. It also cut off entirely the opportunity to really, really get into those obtuse questions and guess at each other until you jog your memory finally and get the right answer.

**Asking locally-relevant versions of questions.** I was onced asked a question about something that had happened to Steph Curry a week or so before. I had no idea what it was because I don't follow basketball, but it was definitely my fault because I was in San Francisco and Steph Curry is an important part of the culture.

At this new trivia, I was asked a question about who took Brett Favre's place in a game in 2007. Not only was that 14 years out of date, but it was for a team thousands of miles away. I didn't consider the fact that I got it wrong my fault,even though every football fan considers it obvious.

The distinction I'm trying to make here is that the Steph Curry question isn't purely a sports question. It's also asking "do you pay attention to things that are important to people around you, even if they aren't important to you?" The Brett Favre question, by contrast, is a curt "do you watch football?". The former is both much more engaging in its flavor and delivery, and gives a glimmer of hope to those who aren't basketball fans.

**Proving context, or, jogging your memory versus straight recall.** The three-part questions, for example. They also give you something to latch onto if you don't immediately know the answer.

**Paper, not phone.** If I'm on my phone, I'm not with my friends. I could even do the trivia from home. Less is very much more in this case.

Taken together, one might say that these are a variety of ways to say "trivia is fun when it's easier". To some degree, that's true -- it's less fun to lose, but it's really anti-fun to lose by a lot or even to feel like you never had a chance. And anyway, what is the point of _hard_ trivia? I see only two: to make the winners feel better, and to clearly separate the winners from the losers. To the first point: who cares. To the second point: this can be done in a way that is more flavorful and engaging for the losers, such as by sprinkling only a couple really hard questions in among the regular ones. You also don't need huge margins to separate the winner. And to remember that bar trivia's first goal is to be fun, not to find the best team.

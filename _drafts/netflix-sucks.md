This is becoming clearer with each passing year, though I still get surprised looks every now and then when I tell people I think Netflix sucks.

I think a lot of people mistake _expensive-looking_ for _good_. (Note that it's expensive _looking_. A lot of these shows are still relatively cheap.)

Ignore the formulaic schlock that they turn out with truly impressive speed -- the stuff that you [aren't really supposed to pay attention to](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/). Their "prestige" shows are still difficult to watch. Stranger Things is shameless 80s nostalgia layered on top of a [Lost-quality plot](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/news/lost-writer-admits-they-just-made-it-up-as-they-went-along-9977472.html), neither of which can sustain a show with any depth. House of Cards started strong but quickly devolved into wildly unbelievable plotlines. The Fall of the House of Usher mocks Poe, turning his stories into gorefests, fuckfests, or both. Arrested Development was tragically sterilized after being "rescued" by Netflix and Black Mirror became a pale, trope-y imitation of its former self.

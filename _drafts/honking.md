title: Let's Use Hardware Subscriptions for Good
---

This early morning I saw someone honk at apparently nothing, and it got me thinking: the driver is cocooned in their brand new Mercedes station wagon, but the people that live on that street likely have to suffer tiny offenses to their sanity and sound environment on a daily basis. It's a mental health hit-and-run, perpetrated one honk at a time.

In all my life I can think of precisely one environment in which I have seen honking used for its purported safety benefits.

Just yesterday I was talking about this utterly ridiculous attempt by BMW to make seat heaters a subscription.

Then it hit me: why not use a subscription model for honking? Like insurance, a honking subscription would be compulsory, and in order to have the desired effect, it would be pay-per-use. There's a ton of variations and angles here:

How to prevent the sunk cost fallacy? Honking gets more expensive the more you use it.

But wouldn't it be regressive and punish the poor unduly, like parking tickets? Okay, instead make it super cheap, like 5 cents a honk, or 1 cent a honk. Then mandate that you have to pay by check or cash in person or through the mail. No online payments, no credit cards. You want to inconvenience the people around you? We're going to inconvenience you. Don't pay your 37 cent fee? You get hit with a fine, scaled to your income (like speeding tickets in Sweden (?)). Cap the penalties -- we don't want poor people's cars being repossessed because of an unpaid 37 cent fee. The goal here is to be obnoxious and petty, not cruel.

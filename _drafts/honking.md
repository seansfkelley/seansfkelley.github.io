title: Let's Use Hardware Subscriptions for Good
---

One early morning in NYC I saw someone honk for some time at apparently nothing, and it got me thinking: this driver is cocooned in their brand new Mercedes station wagon and in total control about when and where to blast their negativity outwards, but the people that live on that street likely have to suffer tiny offenses to their sanity and sound environment on a daily basis through no fault of their own. It's a mental health hit-and-run, perpetrated one honk at a time.

In all my life I can think of precisely one situation in which I have seen honking used for its purported safety benefits, namely, warning people coming around blind curves. Those don't exist in NYC.

Just yesterday I was talking about that utterly ridiculous attempt by BMW to make seat heaters a subscription (which they [cancelled](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/bmw-relents-on-heated-seat-subscription.html), by the way, so don't worry).

Then it hit me: what if there was a subscription model for honking? Like car insurance, a honking subscription would be compulsory, and in order to have the desired effect, it would be pay-per-use. There's a ton of variations and angles here.

I know you have questions. I have answered all of them below.

How to prevent the sunk cost fallacy? Honking gets more expensive the more you use it.

But wouldn't it be regressive and punish the poor unduly? Okay, make it super cheap, like 5 cents a honk, or 1 cent a honk. Then mandate that you have to pay by check or cash in person at the DMV or USPS. No online payments, no credit cards. You want to inconvenience the people around you? We're going to inconvenience you. Don't pay your 37 cent fee? You get hit with a fine, scaled to your income (like speeding tickets in Sweden (?)). Cap the penalties -- we don't want people's cars being repossessed because of an unpaid 37 cent fee.

What if you only honk a really tiny amount, like once a month? Doesn't the punishment become completely disproportionate to infrequent offenders?

What about the safety considerations of people avoiding honking when they should? Per above: when is honking actually useful? Maybe you get a permit for X honks/day if you live in a place with verified blind curves.

Would someone who honks angrily by bopping the wheel multiple times get punished more than someone who does the same by leaning on it? Say that every 1 second of honking is equivalent to a new honk. This will get you to approximately the same amount of honks as someone hitting it repeatedly, but in any case, the point isn't the precise count: the point is the monthly inconvenience. The count just serves to get a gist of the severity of the offenses.

What about all the bureaucracy this would create? Not sure.

The goal here is to be obnoxious and petty to people who are being obnoxious and petty, not to be cruel.

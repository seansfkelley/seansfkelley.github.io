title: The Blast Radius of Inconsideracy
---

Two well-known facts:

- New Yorkers are assholes.
- Anyone, put behind the wheel of a car, becomes a monster.

The unholy combination of these things yields some of the most effortful douchebaggery you'll find anywhere in the world. Take, for instance, Halloween 2022: literally hundreds of children and their parents milling around combined with a partial street closure created some bad traffic on my block, which some jackass in a minivan decided to keep everyone within earshot informed about by leaning of his horn for ten straight minutes _uninterrupted_. (That's not an exaggeration. Time it: ~600 seconds of honking without pause.)

While utterly unnecessary and excessive honking is one of the more salient examples, New York provides triggers for any pet peeve imaginable: bad parking jobs, standing in doorways, blocking the sidewalk, blasting music, bright flashing lights, yelling at 4 AM, name-calling, walking too slowly, entering while people are exiting, cutting lines, video advertisements, not holding doors... the list goes on. If it's obnoxious and in public, New York has it in spades.

Brief venting aside, I'm less interested in the causes than the effects of this widespread shittiness. Another true fact:

- Negative events are remembered and internalized better than positive ones.

This is some kind of reptile-brain survival instinct we're stuck with. What it means is that the only way to tolerate life in New York is to at last become inured to it ("it" being New York and everything in it). Most likely, you'll participate in it passively as it's the only way to survive -- n.b., this needs a better example or justification. For a select few, like our minivan driver, you'll make it a point to participate actively.

It does not take many people pursuing the second and third strategies to make life miserable in what I call the "blast radius of inconsideracy".[^1] For a compelling example, I return to honking: if someone cuts you off, you become angry. If you honk at them, you reflect some of that anger back at them, but also at everyone within earshot. Venting helps, but not much, so all-in _you_ have actually contributed far more shittiness to your environment than the person who cut you off. Congratulations, you're the villain now.

Now imagine living in a place so dense that you have dozens of these interactions a day. A typical office day could be:

- get woken up by honking too early
- crowd onto the subway, where some sweaty fuck next to you didn't put on deoderant this morning
- force your way _off_ the subway car against the tide of morons
- shove past the guy that gets off the elevator and stops immediately because he doesn't know where he's going
- do all of those again in reverse on your way home
- (TODO)

These things happen everywhere, but what is unique to New York in my experience is the frequency with which they happen. As alluded to earlier, it's a self-perpetuating race to the bottom [explain] kicked off by the sheer density of the city [explain].

I'm kind of off track here -- complainig abuot NY specifically instead of the blast radius concept.

[^1]: I also call this the "blast radius of assholery", which gets the point across better, but makes it harder to discuss is more-polite company. So I use the polite name for consistency.

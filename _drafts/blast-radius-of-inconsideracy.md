title: The Blast Radius of Inconsideracy
---

Two well-known facts:

- New Yorkers are assholes.
- Anyone, put behind the wheel of a car, becomes a monster.

The unholy combination of these things yields some of the most effortful douchebaggery you'll find anywhere in the world. Take, for instance, my Halloween 2022: literally hundreds of children and their parents milling around combined with a partial street closure created some bad traffic on the block, which some jackass in a minivan decided to keep everyone within earshot informed about by leaning on his horn for ten straight minutes _uninterrupted_. (That's not an exaggeration. Time it: ~600 seconds of honking without pause.)

While utterly unnecessary and excessive honking is one of the more salient examples, New York provides triggers for any pet peeve imaginable: bad parking jobs, standing in doorways, blocking the sidewalk, blasting music, bright flashing lights, yelling at 4 AM, name-calling, walking too slowly, entering while people are exiting, cutting lines, video advertisements, not holding doors... the list goes on. If it's obnoxious and in public, New York has it in spades.

Brief venting aside, I'm less interested in the causes than the effects of this widespread shittiness. Another true fact:

- Negative events are remembered and internalized better than positive ones.

This is some kind of reptile-brain survival instinct we're stuck with. What it means is that the only way to tolerate life in New York is to at least become inured to it ("it" being New York and everything in it). Most likely, you'll participate in it passively as it's the only way to survive -- n.b., this needs a better example or justification. For a select few, like our minivan driver, you'll make it a point to participate actively.

It does not take many people pursuing the second and third strategies to make life miserable in what I call the "blast radius of inconsideracy".[^1] For a compelling example, I return to honking: if someone cuts you off, you become angry. If you honk at them, you reflect some of that anger back at them, which is fine, but also at everyone within earshot. Venting helps, but not much, so all-in it's actually _you_ that has contributed far more shittiness to the environment than the person who cut you off. Congratulations, you're the villain now. It escalates from there.

These interactions happen everywhere. What's unique about New York in my experience is the frequency of them observed by any one person. If you saw Oppenheimer you may have learned a thing or two about self-sustaining nuclear reactions: it's not enough to have high-energy matter flying about, you also need enough matter crammed into a small enough space that collisions are frequent enough to keep the whole thing going, and in fact, you can start such a self-sustaining reaction simply by piling enough matter in one place _without_ any explicit ignition.

I think you get the analogy,[^2], but I want to put a finer point on that last part: that the culture of assholery in New York emerges not necessarily from something inherent about New Yorkers, but from both the sheer quantity of people and their density, compounded over years and years. It arises from the blast radius of inconsideracy, from the inevitable negative interactions flinging their negativity at everyone with the misfortune of being nearby.

[^1]: I also call this the "blast radius of assholery", which gets the point across better, but makes it harder to discuss is more-polite company. So I use the polite name for consistency.
[^2]: Find-and-replace, if you'd like: "it's not enough to have angry people spreading negativity, you also need enough people crammed into a small enough space that bad interactions are frequent enough to keep the whole thing going, and in fact, you can start such a self-sustaining culture simply by piling enough people into one place _without_ any explicit inciting event."

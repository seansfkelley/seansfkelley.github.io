title: Facebook is a Glorified Yellow Pages
subtitle: "or: Facebook Succeeded Where Yahoo! Failed"
---

Social media has been on peoples' minds increasingly often these last few years. Regardless of where you stand on Twitter moderation, or the relative lack thereof on Facebook, or the continued existence of Parler, surely you agree that _something_ is broken. It appears that nobody is happy with the way things are working except those who stand to make money from it.[^1]

While I am relieved to never again have to hear about Twitter as the mouthpiece of a sitting president,[^2] my first thought after the banhammer came down in January 2021 is [nicely summarized by the ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/podcast/what-does-free-speech-mean-online-ep-139),[^3] which I have excerpted here:

> We understand the desire to permanently suspend him now, but it should concern everyone when companies like Facebook and Twitter wield the unchecked power to remove people from platforms that have become indispensable for the speech of billions...  President Trump can turn to his press team or Fox News to communicate with the public, but others... will not have that luxury.

What's really concerning is not so much that "Facebook and Twitter wield the unchecked power to remove people from [their] platforms" as it is that Facebook and Twitter are considered "platforms that have become indispensable for the speech of billions".

If history is any guide, we know that allowing for-profit companies to become "indispensible" is dangerous. The recklessness of banks and their subsequent bailout during 2008 looms large.[^4] More recently, Texas was rudely reminded of the dangers of for-profit utility infrastructure. In the past, we used to break up companies like AT&T and Standard Oil, and it's safe to say those breakups have served consumer and country well.

But Facebook -- and I'll be focusing on Facebook for most of the rest of this post -- doesn't have to be indispensible. It appears as such because to leave it is to lose easy connectivity not just to friends and family but to more loosely-connected social events and groups you're unlikely to discover and keep up with any other way. This [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) is so strong that it is almost singlehandedly reponsible for the company's dominant position.

Complementing the network effect is the [walled garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform) of tightly-integrated features for communicating with your network. Taken individually, all of Facebook's main features have competitors that are comparable or better. But no single competitor enables you to seamlessly switch from messaging to event hosting to status updates and allow your friends, family and acquaintances to follow along too.

Facebook is leaning into the network effect/walled garden strategy with [supposedly-philanthropic AOL-like initiatives like Free Basics](https://globalmedia.mit.edu/2020/04/21/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-again-of-facebooks-free-basics-civil-and-the-challenge-of-resistance-to-corporate-connectivity-projects/), which is a little tone-deaf coming from a company that [turns a blind eye to systematic abuse in those same areas of the world](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46105934).[^5] Interestingly, they did go through a phase where they thought [unbundling their main features into separate apps](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/can-facebook-innovate-a-conversation-with-mark-zuckerberg/) was the way of the future, but only a few years later they [quietly gave up on that](https://www.facebook.com/fbfacts/390237724681928) since it undermines the walled garden aspect of the strategy.

Many tech companies have used the network effect, walled garden strategy, or both, to grab and keep market share. Social media, almost by definition, relies on the network effect. Google, Apple, Amazon, Netflix do it too, to varying degrees... but Yahoo! tried it years before all of them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yahoo! has had a tumultuous history, which is very apparent from one look at [the Wikipedia page listing its services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Yahoo!-owned_sites_and_services). There are echoes of modern-day social media all over it: the pre-Reddit [Yahoo! Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Buzz) (launched 2000), proto-Pinterest [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)) (founded 2003, acquired 2005), needs-no-introduction [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) (founded 1994, acquired 1999) and the [recently, tragically discontinued alternate reality](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/04/yahoo-answers-babby/) that was [Yahoo! Answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Answers) (launched 2005). That's not to mention Yahoo!'s direct competitors of [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Meme) and [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Screen). For comparison: Facebook was launched in 2004.

Feature-for-feature, Facebook doesn't appear to do anything significantly different that Yahoo! didn't try first, with the glaring exception of _having user identities that tied everything together_. While there are certainly many overlapping reasons Yahoo! is a walking internet relic and Facebook isn't,[^6] the one that stands out is the near-nonexistent network effect. I could make my own GeoCities site, but I couldn't neatly use, say, Yahoo! Answers to engage with interested visitors. I could share bookmark lists with friends on del.icio.us, but the only connection between that and sharing the same links on Yahoo! Buzz was to copy-paste the URLs.

Yahoo! was a bunch of independent communities wearing matching colors. In this way, Yahoo! seems to have adhered to the early-internet ethos that prized decentralization. Each product did one thing, so if you wanted to do that thing, you'd know where to go. It was, in a sense, vertically integrated, and like many vertically integrated things, it ended up siloed.

## everything below here is ???

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But let's fantasize about a world where Facebook wasn't just unbundled, but given the full AT&T treatment.

What would happen if we broke up Facebook? What if all those features were unbundled? What if you didn't have to be in the walled garden to discover like-minded people, or to express yourself to a large audience? These are the questions I would like to explore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's jump right in with some of the simpler features and a little bit of technical detail.

These are called App Links on Android.

iOS has a small but powerful feature called Universal Links. In short, when you follow a link anywhere on an iOS device, it'll prefer to open up the associated app if you have it. There's nothing special required by the sender or the receiver -- all the work is done by the app developer. If I send you a link to `yelp.com` and you have the Yelp app installed, your iPhone will open the Yelp app to the right place instead of dropping you on the less-featureful and less-mobile-optimized site. If you don't you get the site instead -- totally seamless.

Now imagine the same thing for photos.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a broader trend on the internet nowadays towards centralization. Centralization is not inherently a bad thing, though it should be noted that decentralization was a core founding principle of the internet, and why it's able to self-heal from outages or problems, routine or sudden, localized or not, malicious or accidental, physical or social.

TODO ^^^

Do I want to get into a long thing about Tim Berners-Lee and the semantic web, or keep talking about how to recreate social media from its constituent parts?

Hate groups and public shaming spin out of control when you can self-promote. Classical centralization -- radio, TV, newspapers -- and decentralization make that more difficult. We should try to get the best of both.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_"...platforms that have become indispensable for the speech of billions"._ To be beholden to the whims of a for-profit company for access to a wide audience is a concerning thought. Or rather, it sounds like it is, but it's been generally accepted as both unavaoidable and reasonable for hundreds of years in the form of newspapers, radio, and television.

The real underlying problem with social media as it pertains to this type of speech is that we, the general public and users, have a historically unaware and unreasonable opinion on how this type of speech ought to work. Put another way: _why do we think we have the right to instantaneously publish our thoughts to potentially billions of others?_ There is no precedent for that, nor is it self-evidently good or useful. Why is Twitter "indispensable"?

// TODO: Put in an argument for why the following system should exist.

The internet is a fractal hodge-podge. At every level, in every (sub)system, physically, digitally, legally, it's just a bunch of things that seem to work mashed up into an incredible and surprisingly robust whole.

Legally speaking, regulation is all over the place. The FCC of late has been swingly violently from one side of the aisle to the other, GDPR and the CCPA are trying to control at least some emergent behaviors, and social media is a modern Wild West. There's no holistic approach handling which systems exist, why, and what their role is.

My proposal focuses on three main tiers and has some corollary observations afterwards. Something something about this being only about producers of content.

1. **Access.** Access to the internet should always be available. More specifically:

    - ISPs cannot be held liable for the bytes that travel their network, and furthermore, they should not be allowed to discriminate those bytes. Net neutrality, for short. // TODO: Look up the more specific definition of net neutrality and mmake sure I'm not underselling it.
    - Domain registrars should not be held liable for the content of the domains registered with them.
    - Some domain registrars should not be allowed to discriminate against registrants based on the content of the site they host. Call these the "public" registrars.
    - Some domain registrars can disallow certain registrants, but only on the grounds of value-neutral judgements, as they currently do, such by nationality or area of focus. Call these the "private" registrars.

  This is all that I consider mandatory to allow producing content on the internet. If you want to product a hate site, you can, with these rules, but you have to do the rest of the work yourself: buy a physical server, set up we hosting software, pay bandwidth bills.

2. **Hosting.** Hosting companies like AWS cannot be held liable for the content that they host. However, they _are_ allowed to discriminate against that content. Usually, this is called "terms of service".

  This is all that I consider necessary for someone to start politically-neutral web sites, which are the vast majority on the internet: ecommerce, blogs, forums, etc.

3. **Publishing.** Publishing content is defined as "allowing any old schmuck to blast their opinions out to the wider internet with as little as keyboard and couple clicks". Publishers are legally liable for the content on their network in the same way that traditional media publishers are.

The idea here is that you have a right to be able to produce content on the internet, but you do _not_ have a right to a wide audience. That is a privilege that for-profit companies may provide.

// TODO: Include some thoughts on public access domains/hosting/etc.

// TODO: Talk also about anonimity: are you allowed tobe anonymous if you use a public registrar?

// TODO: Talk about private 1:1 messages (not publishing).

"self-evidently good or useful": how about an aside on Facebook thinking that connecting the world is objectively a good and correct thing to do?

compare to traditional media: TV has public access channels, newspaper have editorials, but you don't have a right to blast your opinion to everyone, which is the problem with the internet now

outline

- stumbleupon
- free domains regulated by the government a la public access TV
- no/limited search engines
- social media only for "friends" (you aren't allowed to publish to billions of people)
- private hosts can do whatever
- public hosts of others' content are regulated like publishers

what are the things that make the internet great?

- low barrier to entry
-

With the tide slowly turning against Facebook (and, to lesser degrees, Google and Twitter), I've started to reflect on how I use the internet, what I do and don't value about it, and how to prevent some of the bad tendencies we've started to see.

I'm not an expert on social systems and communities by any means, just someone with an interest in an internet that serves people more than corporations and nation-states. Furthermore, I didn't want to be constrained by existing legal systems and decisions, only by technical ones. In that way, this might be a little impractical to achieve in any short time frame, or at all.

Many of the ideas here grew out of a train of thought focusing on regulating social media companies. I'm not intimately familiar with Section 230 and indeed, for better or for worse, I'm going to more or less ignore it except as it provides explanatory power.

The basic argument was as follows:

- social media companies exercise direct and strong control over what content reaches users -- ranking algorithms, suggested content and at times, censorship

[^1]: Ah, the way of the world.
[^2]: Time will tell, but one can hope.
[^3]: The ACLU has a history of defending rights regardless of ideology -- a [press release in 2012](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-em-defends-kkks-right-free-speech) advertises that they defended the First Amendment rights of the KKK -- and that's reflected in this quote as well. This type of across-the-board defense of civil rights is appealing for its consistency, and lends the ACLU quite a lot of credibility when it takes positions on these cases. Indeed, the [ACLU's page on freedom of expression](https://www.aclu.org/other/freedom-expression) outlines their position nicely, and even has some illuminating clarifications, such as explaining why requiring permits for demonstrations is legal under the First Amendment.
[^4]: Back then it was called "too big to fail".
[^5]: Then again, this is right in line with their [wide-eyed high-schooler's understanding of interpersonal communication](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data#.eeggDmkA3).
[^6]: In addition to the lack of user identities in the style of Facebook, I'll speculate that Yahoo! suffered from too-goofy branding, lack of focus, an inability to be "cool" as the incumbent... and perhaps simple lack of desire to become a social network.

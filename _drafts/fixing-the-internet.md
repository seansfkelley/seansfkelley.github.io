title: A Theory on Fixing Internet Culture
---

outline

- stumbleupon
- free domains regulated by the government a la public access TV
- no/limited search engines
- social media only for "friends" (you aren't allowed to publish to billions of people)
- private hosts can do whatever
- public hosts of others' content are regulated like publishers

what are the things that make the internet great?

- low barrier to entry

With the tide slowly turning against Facebook (and, to lesser degrees, Google and Twitter), I've started to reflect on how I use the internet, what I do and don't value about it, and how to prevent some of the bad tendencies we've started to see.

I'm not an expert on social systems and communities by any means, just someone with an interest in an internet that serves people more than corporations and nation-states. Furthermore, I didn't want to be constrained by existing legal systems and decisions, only by technical ones. In that way, this might be a little impractical to achieve in any short time frame, or at all.

Many of the ideas here grew out of a train of thought focusing on regulating social media companies. I'm not intimately familiar with Section 230 and indeed, for better or for worse, I'm going to more or less ignore it except as it provides explanatory power.

The basic argument was as follows:

- social media companies exercise direct and strong control over what content reaches users -- ranking algorithms, suggested content and at times, censorship

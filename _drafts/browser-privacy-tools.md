mandatory freebies

- block third-party cookies (soon, browsers will do this for you), also, freebie
- HTTPSEverywhere (soon, browsers will do this for you), also, freebie
- password manager

strong recommend

- Ghostery -- if you want a more seamless experience that misses some things
- uBlock Origin -- if you want a generally functional experience that requires occasional unbreaking (once/week?)
  - what lists?
- cookie autodelete -- you really don't need to be logged into that many sites (and you have a password manager anyway)

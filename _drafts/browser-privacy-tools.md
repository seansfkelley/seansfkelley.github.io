title: (Working Title) Browser Privacy Tools
---

Internet privacy is something I have been thinking about increasingly often over the last several years. Over that time period I've iterated a lot on where I like to be on the privacy/convenience spectrum. This post won't get into the broader philosophy (or my philosophy) of internet privacy -- there are [plenty] [of] [other] [good] [explanations] of that -- but is rather an annotated checklist of the main tools, processes and choices I make and would recommend to others.

A major part of my my strategy involves extricating Google from my life. Two things about that. First, that email, contacts and calendars (they always come together in a bundle) were by far the most painful thing to work around

Without further ado.

### Vendors and Hardware

- Apple

### Browser

- Firefox

### Email and Documents

- FastMail
- macOS built-ins
- Dropbox

### Phone

- ???

### Other

- 1Password

mandatory freebies

- block third-party cookies (soon, browsers will do this for you), also, freebie
- HTTPSEverywhere (soon, browsers will do this for you), also, freebie
- password manager

strong recommend

- Ghostery -- if you want a more seamless experience that misses some things
- uBlock Origin -- if you want a generally functional experience that requires occasional unbreaking (once/week?)
  - what lists?
- cookie autodelete -- you really don't need to be logged into that many sites (and you have a password manager anyway)
- containers

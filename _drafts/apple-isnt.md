title: Apple Isn't Breakthrough

Do you happen to remember this?

> Well, today weâ€™re introducing three revolutionary products of this class. The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls. The second is a revolutionary mobile phone. And the third is a breakthrough Internet communications device.

> So, three things: a widescreen iPod with touch controls; a revolutionary mobile phone; and a breakthrough Internet communications device. An iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator. An iPod, a phone... are you getting it?

I was thinking back recently to when I first heard of the iPhone.

Here's my list of things that Apple has released that I think are really breakthrough:

- iPhone

This is despite their [frequent use of "breakthrough" in their marketing materials](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Aapple.com%2Fnewsroom+breakthrough&t=ffab&ia=web).[^1]

Here's a list of things I think they have executed really well on:

- MP3 player
- ultraportable laptop
- stylus and accompanying tablet
- smart watch

title: Thoughts on Cocktail Apps
---

There's this very, very well stocked liquor cabinet sitting in the corner of my living room that is tragically underutilized. I'm not that much of a risk-taker when it comes to making up recipes, indeed, I varyingly self-describe as a purist or a traditionalist in those areas. So without proper guidance, all that booze continues to sit there unconsumed!

I have a bunch of cocktail apps on my phone and have even taken a whack at making my own. I got a couple books and sites I rely on too, but none of these things solve my problem. I'm not even sure what I'm looking for; I'm just hoping that I'll know it when I see it. This post is an attempt to just record what I do and don't like about the various cocktail recipe sources I've used. Maybe by the end I'll have a better idea of what I think should exist.

## [Diffords Guide](https://www.diffordsguide.com/)

## [Liquor.com](https://www.liquor.com/)

## [Mixel](https://www.mixelcocktails.com/)

A pixel-art cocktail app with a LOT of features and (as usual) the concept of keeping an inventory of what's in your bar to help filter.

### Pros

- Swipeable recipe cards. When you've filtered down a set of recipes that look promising, it's nice to be able to flip through them quickly until one strikes your fancy.
- Percent-match is a great filter to have. So many apps hide results from you when you're missing something trivial like lemon juice: I can go to the store! Fuzzy-match, especially for the easy stuff!
- Flavor tags are nice for finding something that matches your mood.
- Can create not just recipes, but also ingredients!
- Ingredient categorization is composed of a category and a subcategory, and generally, they seem to reasonably cover the space without being overwhelmingly specific or uselessly vague.
- The pixel art is a great (and differentiating!) way to sidestep the problem of needing good-looking photos for every recipe. It also means custom recipes can visually fit right in with the default recipes.
- Pivoting between recipes/ingredients/flavors/packs is pretty fluid. This dovetails nicely with my usual usage patterns, which rely heavily on wandering around waiting for something to strike my fancy.

### Cons

- Poor discoverability. The home page is cutesy, but there are a lot more interactive things there than it first looks like. The swipeability of recipe cards is not self-evident.
- Unnatural interactions (at least, on iOS): things you expect to be swipeable aren't always; add/delete operations have small tap targets and are unidiomatic; mixed navigation paradigms (such as when going through the list of all ingredients).
- Too many Untappd-like features cluttering it up: like/tried/pictures/star ratings...
- It has bookmarks _and_ favorites? Why?
- Recipe packs are meh. I guess they're a way to monetize it, so I can't blame them, but as an organization scheme I find it useless.
- The minimal recipe view is kind of silly and adds another button -- why not just tidy up the main recipe view?
- I don't understand why you would need to have saved filter sets.
- Filtering capabilities are borderline overwhelming, and while undeniably powerful, require a lot of attention to use fully.

## [Cocktail Flow](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cocktail-flow-drink-recipes/id486811622)

## [Lush](http://lushapp.co/)

## [Kindred Cocktails](https://kindredcocktails.com/)

A community site specializing in weird, fancy or homemade cocktails, with an extensive ingredient inventory and not an IBA cocktail in sight.

### Pros

- "A spontaneous libation for your consideration." As someone who wanders around these sources looking for something interesting, this is great place to start.
- Similar recipes. I'll often search for some ingredients, find something that's almost what I want, and then follow a series of "similar to" links until I've found the thing I didn't know I was looking for.
- Ingredient metadata works surprisingly well given how obviously detailed their taxonomy is.
- Many, many ingredients have their own pages which don't just link out to example recipes (nice!) but also have a picture and a blurb, which can allow you to make educated substitutions.
- Shows you ingredients alongside cocktail names in the lists, so you don't have to click into them to find out if they sound good to you.

### Cons

- Cannot be a one-stop-shop, because it tries very hard to keep the submitted recipes interesting and unique.
- Miscellaneous UX awkwardness, especially around the somewhat buggy ingredient autocomplete and results navigation.
- The community is nice, but is a distraction from what I'm trying to do. Star ratings, comments, etc.
- Not an app, and not fluid/non-expert-friendly enough to use while you're hosting a cocktail party or making drinks for someone else.

## Takeaways

Things I want:

- Pivoting/similar to.

Things I don't need:

- Inventory management. Too much work, not enough value.

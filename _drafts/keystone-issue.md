title: What's Your Keystone Issue?
---

A question I like to ask people is: what is your #1 _keystone issue_ to resolve?

This is a term I made up to describe a problem and accompanying solution that, if implemented, would fix not just the issue in question but would have downstream effects improving many other aspects of our current socio-econo-political situtation, all else equal.

That's the theory, at least, since you can't predict the future and the idea of getting anything of substance or import changed in this political climate is laughable. So for the purposes of the thought experiment, don't let political feasibility constrain you, but do try to keep the change as focused as possible. I find this makes it more interesting in that it encourages ideas that could be turned into law (metaphorically) overnight without requiring the private sector to cooperate and without creating hugely complex government entities.

You can also think of this as a root cause, the domino effect, foundational change, or pipe dreams. Take your pick.

Here's a few I've come up with or heard of, in no particular order:

- **Reverse [Citizen's United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC).** It should be self-evident why reversing the effective legalization of bribery is helpful, but to spell it out: in the absence of true campaign finance reform (which I judge as out of scope for this question), at least reverting to a state where there were donation limits and their provenance had to be clearer would in theory take power from a small set of rich people and give it back to everyone else. Who would then, obviously, make well-informed and dispassionate decisions about who to elect to improve everyone's quality of life going forward. (Just kidding.)
- **Implement a severe [wealth tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax).** If it becomes effectively impossible to have assets over _$X_ (think: 100% tax brackets), then it would strongly disincentivize the formation of megacorporations and blunt the short-term greed that leads to things like runaway private equity firms.[^1] This should help the return of mom-and-pop or regional businesses that focus more on a mere "tidy profit" than "maximum value extraction" and would presumably provide better quality service and treat their employees better.
- **Minimum wage.**
- **Minimum teacher salaries.**
- **Ranked-choice voting.**

And for completeness' sake, a few ideas that come up that I think are out of scope for the narrow description provided above:

- **Universal healthcare.** Implementation is a logistical nightmare and requires coordination with entrenched insurance companies.
- **Campaign finance reform.** Too far-ranging.

[^1]: There is then the follow up question of, what is _X_? I like to pick a number that is so astronomical that nobody could reasonably do anything with all of it, but would still serve a role in our capitalist system of transmuting greed into theoretically "productive" uses, and is yet small enough that it would find huge amounts of money to put to the public good. $1 billion seems like a good pick for this as it would generate upwards of $1 _trillion_ from just the [top 10 richest people](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#5cc8c2773d78). And really, are these absentee tech billionaires (plus Warren Buffet) _actually_ providing any value these days?

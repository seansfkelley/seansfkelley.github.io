title: What's Your Keystone Issue?
---

A question I like to ask people is: what is your #1 _keystone issue_ to resolve?

This is a term I made up to describe the idea of a large problem with a small resolution, in particular, a problem that if resolved would have many indirect benefits but would have a relatively simple implementation.

I'm not interested in this question to gauge which political splinter group someone belongs to, but more because (1) the idea of pursing underlying solutions rather than constant treating of the political symptoms is a nice change of pace and (2) it scratches my itch for [min-maxing](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing).

You can also think of this as root-causing, the domino effect, foundational change, or pipe dreams. Take your pick. The "simple implementation" requirement is particularly important to make me feel better (just, generally), since the idea of getting literally anything of significance done in our current political climate is laughable. A simple implementation is one that could be enacted more or less by fiat without huge movements of material or manpower. Tax code changes: yes. Infrastructure projects: no. Universal healthcare: also no, sorry.

Here's a few I've come up with or heard of, in no particular order:

- Reverse [Citizen's United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC)
- Implement [wealth tax with a 100% bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax)[^1] (did I mention that political feasibility isn't a requirement?)
- **Minimum wage.**
- **Minimum teacher salaries.**
- **Ranked-choice voting.**

And for completeness' sake, a few ideas that come up that I think are out of scope for the narrow description provided above:

- **Universal healthcare.** Implementation is a logistical nightmare and requires coordination with entrenched insurance companies.
- **Campaign finance reform.** Too far-ranging.

[^1]: This one is its own, nested opinion question. -- There is then the follow up question of, what is _X_? I like to pick a number that is so astronomical that nobody could reasonably do anything with all of it, but would still serve a role in our capitalist system of transmuting greed into theoretically "productive" uses, and is yet small enough that it would find huge amounts of money to put to the public good. $1 billion seems like a good pick for this as it would generate upwards of $1 _trillion_ from just the [top 10 richest people](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#5cc8c2773d78). And really, are these absentee tech billionaires (plus Warren Buffet) _actually_ providing any value these days?

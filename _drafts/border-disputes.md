title: A Survey of Border Dispute Resolutions
---

In this post, we will explore solutions to long-standing border disputes proposed by a variety of different consumer goods and services. While there is a [huge list of ongoing border disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territorial_disputes), we will, for the sake of brevity, consider only the following ones (in alphabetical order):

- [Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_occupation_of_Crimea)
- [Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict)
- [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles)[^ireland]
- [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories#Political_status_and_sovereignty)
- [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_status_of_Taiwan)

[^ireland]: This is the only entry on the list that, as of this writing, is settled, but I found an example that was too good to pass up so I had to include it.

Due to the nature of the goods and services in question, not all of them propose solutions to all the aforementioned disputes.[^provider] I think this is commendable; it is better to do one thing well than to try to solve all problems at the same time. As such, I will discuss only those solutions readily apparent in each good or service and leave the others unaddressed.

[^provider]: On an actually somewhat serious note, it's worth pointing out that the providers of these goods and services may be restricted by their government to a specific rendition of the relevant maps (China is [known to do this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China#Map_content)) or may not even know that there is a border dispute at all and just picked whatever came up first on Google (which suggests the kind of power a private for-profit company can have over education and geopolitics).

(Look, I don't come up with the names, I just report them.)

This map takes a largely conventional approach to our selection of disputes, with the exception of the Kashmir, which it assigns almost entirely to Pakistan excepting one (or possibly both -- it's difficult to tell) of China's claimed territories, which it assigns to China.

This shower curtain should be more amenable than the previous to any Indian guests you may have staying over. It takes the rather more pragmatic approach of assigning the Kashmir to India and Pakistan according to what territory they currently exert control over, which is at the very least an uneasy stalemate rather than an outright hostile takeover.

However, this map also takes a very confused stance with respect to mainland China. China's claims in Kashmir are given to India, but in exchange Taiwan is colored the same as mainland China.

It's possible this latter point may be an artifact of poor graphic design, since the map also gives Angola, Zambia and Mozambique, which are all in a row next to each other, the same (or nearly the same) color. These three countries do not, to my knowledge, have border disputes covering the entirety of their respective territories. If it is simply poor design, we may safely consider that this map would be distasteful to any mainland Chinese guests you may have over.

A map that covers only Europe but not-to-subtly excludes Ukraine and Russia[^css] entirely should be largely free of controversy. Leaving aside the out-of-scope question of whether Turkey is in Europe or not (and why Iceland and Moldova are absent despite definitely being in Europe), we can see a very creative solution indeed to the historic dispute over Northern Ireland: dig a moat! If you look closely you can see that they seem to include a small isthmus, presumably to preserve land access while still constricting the geography to emphasize the distinction between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

This map also makes some unrelated proposals around filling in large lakes in Norway, but given that this would be a Norwegian domestic issue I won't discuss it further other than to note that it was included.

[^css]: The original source for this is a vector image, meaning that you can inspect the internals for more information. Unsurprisingly, it secretly includes all the missing countries noted above (as well as some parts of North Africa), but the tidbit of most interest is that Russia gets a unique `ru` marker (CSS class). No other countries have unique markings, country code or otherwise. I wonder what that means.

## TODO

- https://www.amazon.com/Wood-World-Wall-Large-D%C3%A9cor/dp/B09BR3WFP7/ref=sr_1_9
- include a section that shows what Apple maps shows
  - only uses dotted lines for Kashmir
  - assigns Crimea to Ukraine
- name which disputes are covered by each item and include ea little preview for reference

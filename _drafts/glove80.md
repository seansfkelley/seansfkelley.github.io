title: Glove80 Keyboard Review
---

I bought myself one of [these](https://www.moergo.com/):

I previously used (and adored) one of [these](https://ergodox-ez.com/):

Most of the thoughts I have below will be on the relative differences between these two.

### Feel

The keyboard halves are very light, and you can feel it. When I switch back to the ErgoDox, the travel, bottoming out and heft is considerably more satisfying and stable. The Glove80's low profile switches and keykaps rattle slightly when you move the keyboard around, and when you go back to a heavier keyboard you realize that the it doesn't dampen the vibrations from tapping at all.

The low profile keys do not bottom out in the same way that full-size keycaps do. This is obvious in retrospect, but I've never had them before. My ErgoDox has [Cherry MX Browns](https://www.cherry-world.com/mx2a-brown) because the bottoming out makes them a nice amount of clacky without being too obnoxious. The [Kailh Choc v1 Browns](https://chosfox.com/products/kailh-chocs?variant=42514647646402)[^1] I have on the Glove80 are almost completely silent, which is more practical but also a bummer. I would have considered the clicky Blues to make up for it had I known this.

[^1]: I'm guessing from the "v1" that this is an older model. They aren't listed on the Kailh site at all and I only found a few places online that sold them.

### Build Quality

The build does feel a bit cheap given the cost. I accidentally dropped one half a couple inches onto the desk and now there are permanently dulled corners with obvious damage. Why didn't they just bevel it like the ErgoDox edges?

The case that it comes with is very nice, if bulky. The two halves fit very snugly into their molded holders and there's a little room to spare for replacement parts and the relevant tools (like the keycap puller).

### Durability

It's easy to break the switches. I broke one within a week by pulling out the keycaps too hard (which, to be fair, they warn you about). The keycaps _really_ grip the switches in not always a good way, and unlike the ErgoDox the switches aren't hot-swappable so it was a two-week-long affair to order replacement switches and then get a friend of a friend to solder one on for me. Lesson learned: buy the extra switches when you buy the keyboard.

I would think twice before putting the keyboard directly in a backpack or duffel. I have never thought twice about doing the same with the ErgoDox, and it has never been a problem.

### Size, Layout and Reachability

This is the first concave keyboard I've owned. I think

### Customizability and ZMK

### Wireless Connectivity

The Bluetooth connection is flawless. It can connect to 4 Bluetooth connections simultaneously and will switch between them instantly with the (default) 2-keystroke combination. It also provides status lights on demand for the connections so you can see which are active/idle/disconnected.

### Battery Life

Battery life is not a problem. I'm glad it's USB-C on both halves as well. I have no idea why the ErgoDox chose the rare and obnoxious USB mini-B (_not_ micro-B). I had to special-order a mini-B to C cable just for the keyboard to avoid having a permanently attached dongle.

### Conclusion

The Glove80 does fix pretty much all the problems of the ErgoDox, but it introduces a few to replace it. Between that and the "stylistic" choices around keycap size and high portability at the cost of durability and heft, it's not a slam dunk replacement.

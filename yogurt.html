  </header><p>Makes as much yogurt as milk you put in. Scales up or down indefinitely.</p>

<p>In addition to the ingredients, you’ll need one or more containers equalling the volume of milk you use, an ice bath, and a sous vide machine (or a few towels).</p>

<p>If you use a sous vide machine, this recipe will require about 4 hours of fermentation. Make sure the containers are tall enough or seal tightly enough that they will not leak into the bath.</p>

<p>If you do not use a sous vide machine, the recipe will probably require more than 4 hours of fermentation, and the final product will likely be thinner. You may also want to start the fermentation <span class="unit metric">3°C</span><span class="unit imperial">5°F</span> hotter, to keep the yogurt cultures in their preferred temperature range for longer (but not too hot!).</p>

<p>You can reculture some store-bought yogurts, as long as they specify they have live cultures, which you can find in both cheap and expensive yogurts.</p>

<hr />

<p>Heat</p>

<ul>
  <li>½ gallon whole milk</li>
</ul>

<p>in a pot over medium heat until it reaches <span class="unit metric">95°C</span><span class="unit imperial">200°F</span>, stirring frequently to minimize scalding, and skimming off the skin as necessary.</p>

<p>Prepare an ice bath for the milk. Chill, stirring frequently to ensure even cooling, until it reaches <span class="unit metric">45°C</span><span class="unit imperial">110°F</span>.</p>

<p>Add</p>

<ul>
  <li>½ cup yogurt</li>
</ul>

<p>to a small bowl. Spoon approximately ¼ cup of milk into the yogurt, stirring to combine, then repeat a couple more times until the yogurt is warmed and diluted.</p>

<p>Pour the yogurt mixture back into the milk pot, and stir thoroughly.</p>

<p>If you’re using a sous vide machine, set it to <span class="unit metric">45°C</span><span class="unit imperial">110°F</span>. Divide the milk mixture into your containers, and put them in the sous vide bath. Sous vide for 4 hours.</p>

<p>If you are not using a sous vide machine, leave the milk mixture in the pot and wrap it completely with towels. Set it in a warm place in the kitchen for at least 4 hours.</p>

<p>The yogurt is done when it reaches your desired consistency and tartness. Longer fermentations will thicken the yogurt (to a limit) and make it more tart. Remember that cold yogurt is thicker! If you want to make Greek yogurt, strain through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer until your desired consistency is reached.</p>

        This filthy trick makes sure that the content always weakly tries to expand to the full
        width available, but allows for linebreaks if the viewport is too small. It produces a
        better result than, say, width: 100%; or width: some-fixed-pixel-amount; and doesn't require
        rewriting everything to flexbox (which would mess with the <html>-level scroll behavior and
        sticky header) or adding extra DOM (which I'm trying to minimize to make myself feel good).

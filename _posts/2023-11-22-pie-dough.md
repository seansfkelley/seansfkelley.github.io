Makes sufficient dough for one 9" pie (no top).

Cut

- {% unit "10 tbsp" "150g" %} cold unsalted butter

into {% unit '⅛"-¼"' "5mm" %} cubes and put them in the freezer for 30-45 minutes.

Prepare half a cup of ice water. In a food processor, combine

- 200g all-purpose flour
- {% unit "½ tsp" "3g" %} salt

then add the butter chunks and sprinkle in

- {% unit "4 tbsp" "60 ml" %} ice-cold water

Pulse several times for a total of approximately 15 seconds until it resembles a coarse meal that adheres to itself slightly in {% unit '½"-sized' "centimeter-sized" %} chunks (see images below). Add up to {% unit "4 tbsp" "60 ml" %} more cold water in small increments if that doesn't happen.

Pour the mixture onto a cutting board/counter and quickly compress it into a ball with your hands. Wrap it loosely in plastic, then flatten it into an even disk, re-compressing the edges if they split (which will make rolling it out easier).

Refrigerate at least 2 hours.

My [recommended blind baking technique](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-blind-bake-a-pie-crust#toc-tip-6-forget-weights-use-sugar) uses sugar instead of weights. {% unit "350°F" "175°C" %} for 1 hour! Fold over the foil to protect the crust from the start, and consider 3-5 minutes at the end after you take the sugar out to give the bottom a little extra time.

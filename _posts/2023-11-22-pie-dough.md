title: Pie (Pastry) Dough Recipe

---

Makes sufficient dough for one 9" pie (no top).

Cut

- 10 tbsp cold butter

into 1/8" cubes and put them in the freezer for 30 minutes.

Prepare some ice water. In a food processor, combine

- 200g all-purpose flour
- ½ tsp salt

then add the butter chunks and sprinkle in

- ¼ cup (4 tbsp) ice-cold water

Pulse several times for ~15 seconds until it resembles a coarse meal. Add up to 4 tbsp more cold water if that doesn't happen. (I like to look for when, after stopping a pulse, the coarse meal sticks together into just a few ½"-sized loose chunks and falls off the side into the middle.)

Pour the mixture onto a cutting board/counter and quickly compress it into a ball with your hands. Wrap it in plastic, then flatten it into an even disk.

Refrigerate at least 2 hours.

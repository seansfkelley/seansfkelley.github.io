{% include unit-switcher.html %}

Makes sufficient dough for one 9" pie (no top).

Cut

- {% unit "10 tbsp" "150g" %} cold butter

into {% unit '1/8"' "5mm" %} cubes and put them in the freezer for 30 minutes.

Prepare some ice water. In a food processor, combine

- 200g all-purpose flour
- {% unit "½ tsp" "3g" %} salt

then add the butter chunks and sprinkle in

- {% unit "4 tbsp" "60 ml" %} ice-cold water

Pulse several times for ~15 seconds until it resembles a coarse meal. Add up to {% unit "4 tbsp" "60 ml" %} more cold water in small increments if that doesn't happen. (I like to look for when, after stopping a pulse, the coarse meal sticks together into just a bunch of {% unit '½"-sized' "centimeter-sized" %} loose chunks and slowly falls off the side into the middle.)

Pour the mixture onto a cutting board/counter and quickly compress it into a ball with your hands. Wrap it loosely in plastic, then flatten it into an even disk.

Refrigerate at least 2 hours.

My [recommended blind baking technique](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-blind-bake-a-pie-crust#toc-tip-6-forget-weights-use-sugar) uses sugar instead of weights. {% unit "350°F" "175°C" %} for 1 hour!

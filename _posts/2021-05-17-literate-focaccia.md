This recipe is my adaptation of [Samin Nosrat's Ligurian Focaccia](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/fat/ligurian-focaccia), rewritten in a style inspired by [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

Why rearrange it so? I know how to make this recipe and I know I have all the ingredients, but I always forget the timings and orderings. Here, the timing is the most prominent organizing principle (as opposed to, say, the ingredients list) so that you can at a glance see how much work needs to be done when, thereby making it easier to both plan around it and jump back into it when your timer goes off.

In the interest of streamlining, I have also made some tweaks the to content, both in removing now-redundant text (namely, some of that having to do with timing) and skipping detail I consider extraneous to bakers experienced with the recipe (such as volume measurements or the type of salt).

As always with a recipe, you should read the entire thing before starting. In particular, there are some steps that specify time ranges, such as the main part of the bake (25-30 minutes). I have chosen to use the smaller of the two values to organize and estimate those steps to nudge the baker towards checking in as soon as is reasonable and with the assumption that it is easier and more apparent to extend a step's estimated time rather than notice that you can start a step earlier than the name suggests.

{% literate_recipe_step duration="10m" %}

In a medium bowl, stir together

- 600 grams lukewarm water
- ½ teaspoon dry yeast
- 15 grams honey

until dissolved.

In a very large bowl, whisk together

- 800 grams all-purpose flour
- 18 grams salt

Add yeast mixture and

- 50 grams olive oil

to flour mixture. Stir with a rubber spatula until just incorporated, then scrape the sides of the bowl clean and cover with plastic wrap. Leave out at room temperature to ferment for 12 to 14 hours until at least doubled in volume.

{% endliterate_recipe_step %}
{% literate_recipe_step wait="12h" duration="5m" %}

Spread

- 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil

evenly onto a 18-by-13 inch (46-by-33 cm) rimmed baking sheet. Use a spatula or your hand to release it from the sides of the bowl and fold it onto itself gently, then pour out onto pan. Pour an additional

- 2 tablespoons olive oil

over dough and gently spread across. Gently stretch the dough to the edge of the sheet by placing your hands underneath and pulling outward. The dough will shrink a bit, so repeat stretching once or twice over the course of 30 minutes to ensure dough remains stretched.

{% endliterate_recipe_step %}
{% literate_recipe_step wait="15m" duration="1m" %}

Repeat gentle stretching of dough.

{% endliterate_recipe_step %}
{% literate_recipe_step wait="15m" duration="5m" %}

Dimple the dough by pressing the pads of your first three fingers in at an angle. Make the brine by stirring together

- 80 grams lukewarm water
- 5 grams salt

until salt is dissolved. Pour the brine over the dough to fill dimples. Proof focaccia for 45 minutes until the dough is light and bubbly.

{% endliterate_recipe_step %}
{% literate_recipe_step wait="30m" duration="1m" %}

Adjust rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (235°C). If you have a baking stone, place it on rack. Otherwise, invert another sturdy baking sheet and place on rack. Allow to preheat with the oven until very hot, before proceeding with baking.

{% endliterate_recipe_step %}
{% literate_recipe_step wait="15m" duration="1m" %}

Sprinkle focaccia with

- flaky salt

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes directly on top of stone or inverted pan until bottom crust is crisp and golden brown when checked with a metal spatula.

{% endliterate_recipe_step %}
{% literate_recipe_step wait="25m" duration="1m" %}

To finish browning top crust, place focaccia on upper rack and bake for 5 to 7 minutes more.

{% endliterate_recipe_step %}
{% literate_recipe_step wait="5m" duration="5m" %}

Remove from oven and brush or douse with

- 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil

over the whole surface (don’t worry if the olive pools in pockets, it will absorb as it sits). Let cool for 5 minutes.

{% endliterate_recipe_step %}
{% literate_recipe_step wait="5m" duration="1m" %}

Release focaccia from pan with metal spatula and transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.

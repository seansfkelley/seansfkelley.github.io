First things first: _edin-burruh_. That way people know what you're talking about. Second things second: it's "whisky", not "whiskey".

At the time of writing it's been four years since I went to Edinburgh, so the list has slimmed down quite a bit from what it might have been due to cognitive attrition. Anyway, in no particular order:

- **[Rabbie's overnight Highlands tour](https://www.rabbies.com/en-us/tour/loch-ness-inverness-the-highlands-2-day-tour-from-edinburgh):** got a great whirlwind tour hitting Inverness, Ben Nevin, [Culloden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden), [Duncarron](https://www.duncarronmedievalvillage.com/), and the largest full Scottish breakfast I've ever seen (at a real bed and breakfast)! Ask me about coracles sometime.
- **Teutchers Landing:** lovely local pub in an amusingly cobbled-together building and a great selection of scotches.
- **[Scotch Malt Whisky Society (Queen Street)](https://smws.com/venues/28-queen-street-edinburgh):** their whole thing is you order whisky based purely on the tasting notes -- they will not tell you what distillery or whisky it is. Love it.
- **Auchentoshan:** okay this is actually in Glasgow, but the train ride is quick because Edinburgh and Glasgow are a conurbation and it's the nearest notable distillery and offers tours. The tours are great and come with a really interesting tasting at the end.
- **Arthur's Seat:** a mild hike located right in the city with nice views. Great for sunset.
- **Haggis:** the weirdness of haggis is way overblown. I think Americans are just afraid of off-cuts. If anything, it's actually kind of boring -- but give it a try anyway just to know.
- **Cullen skink:** classic dish that's basically fish chowder. Not bad if you're into that kind of thing.
- **Harry Potter walking tour:** honestly you could just look it up on the internet and do it yourself... even as a mild Harry Potter fan it's still kind of interesting to see the subtle or not-so-subtle references made to Edinburgh in the book.
- **Fringe Festival:** I haven't gone, but it sounds like a ton of fun. You'll probably know if you are accidentally going when it's on because of the prices of everything.

[^1]: I'll be nice: you should definitely look up the pronunciation of this before you say it out loud to a Scot.

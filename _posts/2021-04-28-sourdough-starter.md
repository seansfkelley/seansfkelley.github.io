Sourdough starter are the easiest pet you can have. Easier than plants or cats. They have a feeding cycle, but once they’re alive and strong, they’re resilient to your inevitable negligence. If you got a starter from me, know that it's almost old enough to vote at this point (the person I got it from said it was from 2005-ish). I've also definitely forgotten it in the fridge for longer than I'm willing to admit, and it's doing just fine.

I like keeping starters at 100% hydration, which means it's half water and half flour. That makes it a “liquid” starter (as opposed a “stiff” starter). You can tweak the balance all you want once you know what you’re doing; there is nothing magical about any numbers you’ll see here except for convenience.

A typical feeding for my starter:

1. Put 20g starter in a bowl. Discard or [bake](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016277-tartines-country-bread) with the rest.[^1]
2. Add 100g water and 100g all-purpose flour.
3. Mix thoroughly, cover with a plate, leave it on the counter, and come back tomorrow.

The (relative) 10:1 proportions of starter to flour/water mixture get pretty close to a 24-hour cycle and are easy to remember. The (absolute) amount of 220g works nicely with a lot of recipes, which generally call for about 200g of starter. The 100% hydration makes it easy to do math with when you’re converting a dry yeast recipe to one with starter.

If you feed your starter more often, it’ll become less sour. 12-hour cycles instead of 24-hour ones are enough to make a difference; any more frequent than that and you aren’t letting the starter eat all the food. The sourness comes from acetic acid produced by bacteria, not yeast, but the yeast generally outcompete the bacteria right after a feeding and mellow the starter out. Longer fermentation times while baking will also make your doughs more sour.

You can leave your starter unattended for about a week on the counter or 1-2 months in the fridge. It’s not great and try to avoid doing that regularly, but in a pinch or for long-term storage it’s fine. When you want to wake it back up, be sure to pour off any liquid on top (that’s "hooch", i.e. ethanol, i.e. yeast poison, so don’t believe anybody who tells you it’s okay to mix it in) before doing your feeding. You’ll likely need to feed it a couple cycles before it looks normal again, so plan ahead if you need to.

When using your starter, you can use the float test to determine if it’s ready for baking: if a dollop of it floats in water, it’s good to go. After a while, you’ll be able to tell by eye and by smell (smell for “yogurt sour, not vinegar sour”, as a bagel lady told me once).

I find you can ignore anything on the internet you find about feeding your starter exactly this often, or not using stainless steel, or demanding fancy flour instead of regular all-purpose, or other such commandments. Those people are either referring to new starters (which are indeed fragile), but are usually just misinformed. It’s a colony of billions of highly successful organisms: they aren’t going to spontaneously die because you used the wrong utensil. That said, I just use my finger, because why dirty another utensil?

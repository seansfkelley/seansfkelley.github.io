This recipe is my transcription and adaptation of [A Non-Baker's Guide To Making Sourdough Bread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APEavQg8rMw), written in a style loosely inspired by [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). A bit more background on what this "literate recipe" thing is at [my focaccia recipe]({% post_url 2021-05-17-literate-focaccia %}).

This recipe is intended as a terse reference for those already familiar with the recipe, or sourdough breads in general. If you aren't very experienced, you can watch the full video recipe linked above (also great as a visual reference), follow [Tartine's Country Bread](https://tartinebakery.com/stories/country-bread) recipe, and/or check out [my advice on maintaining a starter]({% post_url 2021-04-28-sourdough-starter %}).

Onto the recipe!

{% literate_recipe_step duration="5m" %}

Feed your starter with

- 100 grams lukewarm water
- 100 grams bread or all-purpose flour[^1]

{% literate_recipe_step wait="12h" duration="10m" %}

In a large bowl, mix

- 200 grams starter[^2]
- 400 grams water
- 600 grams bread or all-purpose flour

getting out most of the lumps. Rest, covered, for 30 minutes.

{% literate_recipe_step wait="30m" duration="15m" %}

Add

- 12 grams salt
- splash of water

and mix. Scoop dough out onto hard, non-porous, unfloured surface.[^3] Knead: turn, grab, turn, smash, pull, roll for 10 minutes. You want dough that is smooth, elastic and tacky (but not sticky).

Cover bowl and proof for 4 hours in a warm environment.

{% literate_recipe_step wait="4h" duration="5m" %}

Put dough on unfloured countertop. Sprinkle with flour, and flip. Fold each of the four edges over the center until you get a rough ball.

Rest for 30 minutes.

{% literate_recipe_step wait="30m" duration="10m" %}

Sprinkle with flour and flip. Fold all four edges to their opposite sides. Shape into a ball, then with the dough scraper, firmly push the dough in all directions to roll across the surface and build tension.

Dust a proof basket with flour and transfer the dough to it, seam side up. (If you do not have a proofing basket, you can put a dry kitchen towel in a bowl.)

Dust with flour, cover with towel, and place in fridge overnight.

{% literate_recipe_step wait="12h" duration="1m" %}

Take the dough out of the fridge 2 hours before baking to bring it to room temperature.

{% literate_recipe_step wait="1h30m" duration="1m" %}

Preheat a dutch oven with a lid to 475째F (245째C).

{% literate_recipe_step wait="30m" duration="5m" %}

Flip the dough into the dutch oven using your preferred technique.[^4]

Score it, spritz several times with water, and cover. Place into oven and lower temperature to 425째F (220째C).

{% literate_recipe_step wait="25m" duration="1m" %}

Take the lid of the dutch oven off.

{% literate_recipe_step wait="25m" duration="1m" %}

Take the bread out of the oven and place on a wire rack.

Let cool completely before slicing to allow the structure to set.

[^1]: All-purpose flour _does_ work, it's just less forgiving and the texture is slightly different (but still good!). Bread flour is just high-protein flour, usually about 13%. Some flours state the protein percentage on their package; others mention it on their site. [King Arthur's bread flour](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/bread-flour) is 12.7%. Trader Joe's all purpose was, [in 2014](https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=30417.msg305351#msg305351), 11.8%.
[^2]: Don't forget to save some to feed it again!
[^3]: If you don't have a stone countertop, you can use a baking sheet, though they tend to slide around a lot. You can flour a wooden surface if you really want, but the non-porous surface really does make a big difference.
[^4]: Techniques I have seen: dropping the basket into the dutch oven then palming the top to take it out; flipping the dough onto a plate then picking it up with both hands underneath; inverting the bowl-with-towel above the dutch oven and hoping your aim is good.

I was recently reminded of [kathack.com](http://kathack.com), a gem from the internet's teenage years and still there, 12 years later. To my disappoinment, browser security measures and the adoption of HTTPS everywhere have mostly broken the delivery of the script. It also relies on jQuery which, while it will never die, is not necessary anymore and its inclusion increases the number of things browsers can break about the script.

So anyway, I rewrote out the jQuery and found a way to serve the script indirectly via GitHhub, no dedicated site required. You can paste this into your browser console

```js
s=document.createElement('script');s.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/seansfkelley/kathack@main/kh.js';document.body.appendChild(s);
```

or keep it as a bookmarklet with

```js
javascript:s=document.createElement('script');s.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/seansfkelley/kathack@main/kh.js';document.body.appendChild(s);void(0);
```

or just [click this](javascript:s=document.createElement('script');s.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/seansfkelley/kathack@main/kh.js';document.body.appendChild(s);void(0);) if you want to try it here.

Have fun!

I was recently reminded of [kathack.com](http://kathack.com): a gem from the internet's teenage years that's still there, 12 years later. Unfortunately, browser security measures and the adoption of HTTPS everywhere have mostly broken the delivery of the script. It also relies on jQuery, which will live forever but is another thing to be delivered that might break. And it makes the bookmarklet bigger.

So anyway, I rewrote out the jQuery and found a way to serve the script indirectly via GitHub, no dedicated site required. You can paste this into your browser console

```js
s=document.createElement('script');s.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/seansfkelley/kathack@main/kh.js';document.body.appendChild(s);
```

or keep it as a bookmarklet with

```js
javascript:s=document.createElement('script');s.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/seansfkelley/kathack@main/kh.js';document.body.appendChild(s);void(0);
```

or just [click this](javascript:s=document.createElement('script');s.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/seansfkelley/kathack@main/kh.js';document.body.appendChild(s);void(0);) if you want to try it here.

Have fun!

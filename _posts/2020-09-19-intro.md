title: Hello, world.
---

I've always found it odd, as a reader, when the very beginning of a blog or a web comic launches right into whatever topic was on the mind of the author, as if some earlier content had been lost and you're picking up the story part of the way through.

Similarly, many blogs I read purely for technical, philosophical, or otherwise impersonal reasons, so it makes me uncomfortable when the introduction is, instead, introspective or self-introductory, as if I've accidentally stumbled upon a diary entry that I didn't want to.

So here we are: I have successfully acknowledged that this is the beginning of time without making anyone uncomfortable. Like most blogs, there is no real intent, goal or theme here, though I will attempt to keep the content somewhat impersonal, like the blogs I prefer to read. If a theme should develop later and you find yourself reading this post, well, the next bunch of posts you read in order might be a surprising hodge-podge. Those _are_ what was on my mind when this whole thing started.

According to Wikipedia,[^1] the original hello world program was stylized (if I may use the term) as `hello, world`. Most instantiations I've seen are written `Hello, world!`, though I myself prefer the still-syntatically-correct, less exuberant `Hello, world.`. Let's keep it calm, people.

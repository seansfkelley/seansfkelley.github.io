I learned recently that there are more than a few Greek mythological figures whose names are, _verbatim_, English words. It thought this would be a good excuse for an internet quiz, so here you go.

The quoted definitions are all from Merriam Webster, but I exercised some editorial control to pick recognizable versions and keep them short (and to skip any mythological definitions, obviously).

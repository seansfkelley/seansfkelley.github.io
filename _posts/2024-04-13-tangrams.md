Remember [tangrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram)? Remember how they would mess with your intuition, that the [silhouettes they drew seemed to lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram#Paradoxes)?

I'm working on a large refactor that is composed of two similarly-sized and similarly-structured systems. Let's imagine these systems as two similar tangram tiles.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 0.707 | round }}px" height="{{ scale | times: 0.707 | round }}px" viewBox="0 0 0.707 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,0.707 0.707,0.707 0.707,0" />
  </svg>

  <svg width="{{ scale }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 1,1 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

You can arrange these in a variety of ways, some more aesthetically appealing or easily described than others.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 1.5 | round }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="0 0 1.5 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,1 1.5 0.5" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 1,0 1,1" />
  </svg>
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 1.707 | round }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="-0.707 0 1.707 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 -0.707,1 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,1" />
  </svg>
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 1.414 | round }}px" height="{{ scale | times: 1.207 | round }}px" viewBox="-0.707 -0.707 1.414 1.207">
    <polygon class="one" points="-0.5,0 0.5,0 0,0.5" />
    <polygon class="two" points="-0.707,0 0.707,0 0,-0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

And so it was that I found myself with a software architecture resembling this configuration...

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 0,0 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

The smaller shape represents the underlying domain-agnostic framework for the whole system. Call it the <span class="one">foundation</span>. The larger one is where all the business rules and domain logic lives. Call it the <span class="two">superstructure</span>.

This shape looks unstable and un-elegant. In this analogy, the <span class="one">foundation</span> sort-of supports the <span class="two">superstructure</span> in that it's mostly on the bottom, but parts of it end up pretty high up where a "<span class="one">foundation</span>" probably shouldn't reach. On the other end, the pointy bit that sticks out on the bottom is where the <span class="two">superstructure</span> bypasses the <span class="one">foundation</span> completely, which suggests the <span class="one">foundation</span> isn't providing what the <span class="two">superstructure</span> needs. Plus, the entire system doesn't sit flat.

Through years of organic software growth, these two systems had developed into this configuration that was difficult to change without risking even more instability.

I considered a few methods to rearrange the shapes that could resolve the instability and awkwardness.

Trying to shift the <span class="two">superstructure</span> higher up without fundamentally changing its shape, so that the <span class="one">foundation</span> could at least actually serve as the base and the whole thing could sit flat, was a lot of work against gravity (if you'll permit the mixed metaphors) and still ends up with pointy bits sticking out, just elsewhere.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 0.707,1 0.707,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

Moving entire pieces from one side to the other, like this example from earlier, would be a lot of effort for little gain.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 1.707 | round }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="-0.707 0 1.707 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 -0.707,1 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0,1 1,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

I tried to think outside the box a bit: I could shift responsibility from the <span class="two">superstructure</span> to the <span class="one">foundation</span> to make the entire system bottom-heavy again. This would still require moving a lot of mass around, even if it isn't going very far. And it isn't even clear if this is a meaningful improvement.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="one" points="0,1 1,1 1,0" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,1 0,0.292 0.707,0.292" />
  </svg>
</p>

After some more aborted out-of-the-box ideas, I decided the best course of action would be to sand off the pointy bits and deal with the remaining, irregularly-shaped pieces that still got too close to the tops and bottoms where they shouldn't. At least it would be a rectangle that sits flat.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale }}px" height="{{ scale | times: 0.707 | round}}px" viewBox="0 0 1 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0.707 0,0 1,0 0.292,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

That rectangle sparked an idea. Consider the silhouette -- the view from the outside -- of the entire system.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="silhouette" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0.292,0.707 0,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

Hey... you can construct that with these pieces instead!

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0,0.707" />
    <polygon class="four" points="0,0.707 0.292,0.707 0,1" />
  </svg>
</p>

This layout is still a little awkward, but the relationship of the silhouette to the parts that make it up is _much less surprising_! And all we had to do to get here is to redraw the lines between the shapes. All the mass stayed where it was. We have rearchitected the system away from one where everything was just a little bit wrong to one where the <span class="three">core</span> is highly regular and it just has some <span class="four">hacks</span> bolted onto it. (Ah, software in the real world.)

It's now a lot easier to move the <span class="four">hacks</span> around and change the silhouette, since it has relatively little connection to the <span class="three">core</span>. If we want to make a change to the silhouette for some reason (that is: the system, holistically, as seen from the outside), we can do it with less effort and more flexibility.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 1.584 | round }}px" height="{{ scale | times: 0.707 | round }}px" viewBox="-0.292 0 1.584 0.707">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1,0 1,0.707 0,0.707" />
    <polygon class="four" points="1,0.707 1.292,0.707 1,0.414" />
  </svg>
</p>

Now it lies flat.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale }}px" height="{{ scale }}px" viewBox="0 0 1 1">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,1 1,1 1,0.292 0,0.292" />
    <polygon class="four" points="0.292,0.292 0.707,0.292 0.5,0.094" />
  </svg>
</p>

Now it lies flat _and_ is symmetrical, so the <span class="four">hacks</span> don't grate quite as much. The possibilities are endless, and with some effort, we could even restructure the <span class="three">core</span> to elegantly subsume all the mass from the <span class="four">hacks</span> -- there isn't that much of it!

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 1.060 | round }}px" height="{{ scale | times: 0.707 | round }}px" viewBox="0 0 1.060 0.707">
    <polygon class="three" points="0,0 1.060,0 1.060,0.707 0,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

(Yes: it is ever so slightly wider. Conservation of mass, and all that.)

Let's rewind a bit. What if we _did_ put in the effort to move the original tiles around without redrawing the lines or moving mass between them?

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 1.414 | round }}px" height="{{ scale | times: 0.707 | round }}px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="one" points="0.707,0.707 1.414,0 1.414,0.707" />
    <polygon class="two" points="0,0 0.707,0.707 1.414,0" />
  </svg>
</p>

In a silhouette, that looks like this.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 1.414 | round }}px" height="{{ scale | times: 0.707 | round }}px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="silhouette" points="0,0 1.414,0 1.414,0.707 0.707,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

You might be able to see where this is going.

<p class="svg-container">
  <svg width="{{ scale | times: 1.414 | round }}px" height="{{ scale | times: 0.707 | round }}px" viewBox="0 0 1.414 0.707">
    <polygon class="five" points="0.707,0 1.414,0 1.414,0.707 0.707,0.707" />
    <polygon class="six" points="0,0 0.707,0 0.707,0.707" />
  </svg>
</p>

A different architecture! Like the other one, it's not really a two-layer architecture anymore. The precence of the <span class="five">square</span> is an improvement, since squares have even less variability to consider than rectangles. There's still a <span class="six">triangle</span> sticking out the side, but it matches the side of the <span class="five">square</span> perfectly: a good abstraction boundary, perhaps? Say: a minimal but fully-expressive API that is used mostly at a high level, but doesn't prevent consumers from using the low-level parts when necessary. That sounds like a practial design to me.

The refactor isn't done yet, but at least now I have a plan that is realistic, relatively less effort, and has a long-term path towards something halfway decent. Thanks, tangrams.

title: Cornmeal Pancake Recipe

Makes about a dozen 4"-5" pancakes.

Preheat a non-stick or well-seasoned griddle or small pan to medium-low. Pancakes are very sensitive to uneven heating, so use multiple small pans instead of one large one if you need more space. (This will allow centering the pancakes over the burners.) Pancakes are more like baking than cooking, so having an evenly heated surface ready to go will make it much easier to dial in the temperature as you cook. Don’t butter or oil the pan, as this will cause the pancakes end up splotchy.

In a large bowl, mix:

- 1 cup flour
- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- ½ cup sugar
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 tbsp baking powder

In a small bowl, mix:

- 2 eggs
- ¼ cup vegetable oil

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ones and combine throughly. Add:

- milk

until you have a smooth, thick and just-barely-evenly-pourable batter. When in doubt, err on the side of thicker: you can always add more milk.

To make a pancake, put about ¼ cup batter into the center of the pan. (The batter is thick, so you can use a ⅓ cup measure to pour quickly without having to scrape down the sides.)

Cook a couple minutes, checking the bottom with a spatula and flipping when it’s an even, deep golden brown. The top should be bubbling lightly, but without the bubbles bursting.

Cook until the other side has golden brown patches. (This side will be unavoidably splotchy.)

Serve face up.

title: Why Constructed, Not Commander
---

Hello fellow dork. If you're here, I probably sent you here because you nagged me to play Commander. But I don't like Commander, and here's why.

- The board states are massively complicated. I do like intricate multi-hour Euro games, but that's not the itch that Magic scratches for me. I think Magic is at its best when games that are quick and spunky and where the opponents have clear styles, like tennis.
- I don't like politicking and managing social dynamics. I don't want to knock someone out of a game early even if that's the right strategy because it sucks when that happens to you. You don't generally have to worry about peoples' feelings in constructed. (I also can't stand Diplomacy.)
- The decks take a _long_ time to hone in and interate on. I do spend a lot of time refining my constructed decks, but you can get a working first draft quickly and effectively test changes to even a single playset at a time, so the process is more rewarding.
- Like the companion cycle, the commander (obviously) warps deckbuilding around it, to the degree where a lot of decks are just random in-color shit that's good with the commander and bad without it. Decks with single points of failure (success?) are antithetical to my deckbuilding style, which is part of the reason I don't like combo decks or tutors. I want and build decks with lots of little synergies. My rule of thumb is that any interaction requiring three cards should be considered pure bonus upside, perhaps shading into win-more, and not required for for the deck to work.
- Wizards keeps printing more kinds of state management, many of which have no obvious physical representation. Exert is one such mechanic (how many times have I accidentally untapped an exerted thing...), and good luck remembering the 4,000 different types of behaviors available to cards in exile depending on how they got there. In a constructed matchup you only have a few specific ones to remember and manage. In a game with ~400 unique cards, forget about it.
- Old cards are ugly. (To be fair, a lot of new card frames are ugly too. At least the old cards are not near-impossible to read. But I'd rather have neither.)

Last time I tried to build a Commander deck, I ended up throwing out the 80% of it that was chaff, and kept the 20% that was fun. And then I put in 4 copies of each card. Oops.

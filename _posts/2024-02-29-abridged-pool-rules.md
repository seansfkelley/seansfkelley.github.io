title: WPA Eight-ball Rules (Abridged)
redirect_from: /pool-rules
---

This is an abridged summary of the [official WPA eight-ball rules](https://wpapool.com/rules/). I wrote it because I wanted a short reference for the most important rules to play in an "official" style, for those already familiar with the bar rules. The corresponding full rule's number is cited in \[brackets].

### Racking and the Break

- Rack with the 1 ball at the apex, the 8 ball in the middle, one solid and one stripe in each of the other corners, and the rest randomly. The 1 is placed on the foot spot. \[3.2]
- Lag to determine order of play. Winner chooses to break or have opponent break. \[1.2] \[3.1]
- Table remains open even if a ball is pocketed. \[3.3]
- Fouls on the break are opponent's choice: \[3.3]
  - Accept the balls in position.
  - Ball-in-hand, behind the head string.

### Play and Winning

- The intended ball and pocket must be called if they are not obvious. \[1.6] \[3.6]
- The shooter continues as long as they pocket shots as called and do not foul. Pocketing additional balls is not a foul and does not end the turn. \[3.5]
- The shooter may call "safety", in which case the turn changes even if they pocket a ball legally. \[8.17] \[3.6]
- Fouling while pocketing the 8 ball is a loss. \[3.8]
- Fouling on an 8 ball attempt without pocketing the 8 ball is treated as a normal foul. (My clarification; implied but not stated explicitly in the rules.)

### Fouls

All fouls are ball in hand without restriction, except as noted during the break.

- Scratch (pocketed cue). \[6.1]
- Wrong first ball. \[6.2]
- No contact. \[6.3]
- No rail after contact. \[6.3]
- Bad play from behind the head string. \[6.11]
- Jump shots by "scooping". \[8.16]

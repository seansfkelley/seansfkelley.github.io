Preheat oven to 425°F.

Combine

- 1 ¾ c (15oz can) mashed cooked pumpkin
- ½ tsp salt
- 2 large eggs, plus 1 yolk
- ⅔ cup brown sugar
- scant ⅔ cup evaporated* milk (small 5oz can; substitute whole milk)
- 1 ¼ tsp cinnamon
- ½ tsp ginger
- ½ tsp nutmeg
- ¼ tsp ground cloves

in a medium bowl and mix until combined.

Pour into a [blind-baked crust]({% post_url 2023-11-22-pie-dough %}) and bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the outer 2-3" of the custard looks drier than the middle. After 15 minutes, tent with foil, either perforated extensively or with a large hole in the middle, to prevent the crust from burning or the top discoloring.

\*Not condensed!

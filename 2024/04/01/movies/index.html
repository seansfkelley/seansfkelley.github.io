<p><strong>In general, I don’t recommend watching trailers for any movies.</strong> If you’re here for my recommendations, try to triangulate if you’ll like it from my one-liners or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_line">log line</a> on IMDb. It’s always more fun to go in without expectations (and without spoilers).</p>

There’s nothing wrong with that, but it does have play-like storytelling in that there is a lot of telling instead of showing.</p>

        <p>The set pieces are absolutely incredible. Lots and lots of horses, yes, but the king wandering out of the burning castle while the armies part to let him pass… yowza. They really built and burned a full-size set for that.</p>

        <p>This was a very pretty, if visually austere, movie. I see why people like it, but as you might guess from the one-liner, I’m pretty tired of having this conversation. You end up getting it a lot as a tech nerd.</p>

        <p>I don’t think the rise of LLMs has changed my thoughts on this movie one way or the other. Ultimately more plausible, perhaps, but they neither undermine nor support the thesis of the movie. That might be a comment more on LLMs themselves than this movie or AI generally.</p>

          <div class="more-thoughts spoiler">
        <p>The first half is a legitimately scary movie, even if the snuff films started to get a bit overdone for little added effect. In particular, I like the way they explained away trope-y, spooky sounds with e.g. night terrors, or the way they demonstrated Ethan Hawke wasn’t simply going crazy because other characters corroborated some apparently-supernatural happenings.</p>

        <p>It would have been a significantly better movie if they had held the supernatural reveal until the box of movies reappears in the attic right before the end. You would have spent 95% of the movie scared about a murderous and superhumanly stealthly and methodical stalker, and then, twist, it actually <em>is</em> supernatural and the children get Ringu’d into the home movies.</p>

        <p>I love love love Dune, and think that the movies are an excellent transfer to the screen because they hew so closely to the books at all times.</p>

        <p>This one is a little less exciting for not-already-Dune-fans, and even already-Dune-fans, because it doesn’t get to introduce all the wild world-building and main characters, like the first one did. It’s still absolutely worth rewatching, though probably as part of a marathon.</p>

        <p>I found this movie exhausting. As mentioned above, the characters are comtemptible, the commentary on Gen Z culture superficial and well-trodden, and the decision-making unrealistically awful. The only tolerable non-idiotic character was Lee Pace, and even then, merely tolerable.</p>

        <p>Had I known that the movie did not intend to take itself entirely seriously I would have gone in with different expectations, but I don’t think that would have saved it. The few (in retrospect) genuinely funny lines would have registered as such, instead of coming off as the characters continuing to be obnoxious, but the juice just isn’t worth the squeeze.</p>

        <p>This movie has aged great! By focusing on the insular island culture and minimizing intrusion from the outside, it created an environment frozen in time that focuses on people and interactions, and doesn’t suffer from the “this would be done already if we had cell phones” problem.</p>

        <p>If it didn’t invent all the folk-horror tropes, it certainly solidified them. Christopher Lee is fantastic, and in fact, he has said on several occasions that it was his favorite role. Midsommar owes so, so much to this movie. It’s a tighter, higher-production-value movie, but The Wicker Man’s simpler, more earnest style is a better fit for the “folk” part of “folk-horror”.</p>

        <p>I adored the parodical food-porn glamour shots of each dish and the heavy-handed criticism of haute cuisine and the culture around it, in particular, Ralph Fiennes browbeating the insufferable “foodie” into killing himself from shame. Crazy. Head waiter Elsa was also excellently written and acted.</p>

        <p>Like Cabin in the Woods, I judged this book by its cover and the first half was kind of a slog. When the reveal came halfway through the movie, it was transformed and it’s now up there with things like Primer as an excellently tight movie doing a lot with very little and really rewarding you for paying attention and sticking with it.</p>

        <p>I assume in Japanese the name is a little less clunky. Do they have a single-syllable word for “one cut” so the name’s cadence is closer to Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead or whatever?</p>

        <p>This movie is so pretty, and some of the visual elements would steal the show all by themselves in any other movie. (I’m thinking here of the dangling metal mask that J Lo wears.) The plot is not terribly original, but it is (and should be) considered an entirely visual experience. And it’s worth it for that alone.</p>

        <p>I didn’t like this movie when I first watched it. It felt corny, forced, too far outside the realm of believability but without the rest of the trappings (and benefits) of a more out-there plot.</p>

        <p>But after thinking on it for some time, it’s grown on me, specifically <em>because</em> it’s such an out-there core concept in such mundane trappings. What a strange choice for a representation of… STDs? Sexual assault? Death? It’s chilling how such an innocuous action – literally, following – taken to an extreme becomes so unsettling. Plus, I thought that the characters acted pretty reasonably given the insanity they were subjected to.</p>

It doesn’t even matter what, it’s just the way that it carries itself. Really, it’s more of an… <em>experience</em>… than a story, but that’s not enough to actually recommend anyone else watch it.</p>

        <p>I was convinced that this movie was about mental illness right up until the very end, but the real explanation is much more fun. (Ari Aster confirmed in interview there is no trick. It’s what it says it is.) Just a perfectly balanced movie: freaky but believable people; unsettling but not outright hostile to the audience; a great reveal but not one that feels like a gotcha… And that decapitation scene: the perfect choice.

Minimal props, minimal sets, minimal effects: just a bunch of poeple as confused as the audience trying to figure things out. I loved the idea that the alternate universes varied wildly from “nobody left the house and has any idea that anything is amiss” to “murder body doubles”. Plus, blackouts are (usually) fun.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: the movie was filmed in a few days in the filmmaker’s house, and he only gave each actor their own parts and only the parts they needed for <em>that day</em> of filming. So they’re as surprised as you are.</p>

        <p>Ghosts are my least favorite kind of scare. They require a lot of suspension of disbelief but usually offer little storytelling oomph in return, often less than pagan gods, or witches, or zombies, or those sorts of things.</p>

        <p>I did like some elements and characters of this film, especially the older couple running the orphanage. The child actors are not bad, though the makeup on the ghost boy sure is.

Framing the hand as a party drug was, to my knowledge, a unique approach that allowed to characters to behave like realistically risky, smartphone-wielding teenagers.</p>

        <p>The visual effects struck the perfect balance of creepy without going overboard, and the increasingly-unsubtle audio-visual cues of the possessive underworld woman were a nice touch.</p>

        <p>I love the self-imposed challenge of making a horror movie in broad daylight. I think folk horror, or at least, this strain of it, is all about the pacing, and Midsommar absolutely nails the pacing. You can’t come on too quickly, otherwise you’d scare off the characters/audience who are largely pretty reasonable. Midsommar takes its time, but it never stops: the ramp-up is relentlessly steady; every scene just a little more weird than the last until you realize you’re way past your comfort zone and how did we get here?</p>

        <p>What a mind fuck. This is Aronofsky at his finest. The thing that stuck out the most to me was the visual metaphors for euphoria, paranoia and hallucinations. The editing and camerawork for those did an excellent job conveying a <em>feeling</em> that put you in the character’s shoes.</p>

        <p>The parallel storylines showing four different versions of the same idea, and four different ways they can all go horribly wrong (and worse when they play off of each other), weave together into a surprisingly coherent storyline. At least, as coherent as it can be through the drug haze. I didn’t even find the moral of the story too blunt: we all know where this leads, and the movie did all showing and no telling.</p>

        <p>Full disclosure: I was told, and went in expecting, that this was a horror movie. It’s not. It starts out sort of like one, but once they figure out it’s a UFO-alien, it becomes almost like a heist movie where you spend the first two thirds of the movie gathering the team and the equipment and the last third of the movie executing the heist. Which is fine, and kind of an interesting idea when mashed up like this, but I would rather they just did that from the start and made a different movie instead.</p>

        <p>There were some clever storywriting bits in the “heist” section of the movie, for sure, but the rules felt a little arbitrary and the I-guess-horror-related shots of the inside of the UFO-alien felt more gratuitous and irrelevant to the story than anything else.</p>

        <p>You know how you have that band where you love the first album, and you wish they would just do the same thing again? Some bands do, and it turns out that that’s usually just boring. Some bands go the complete opposite direction and lose the plot. But some bands strike that perfect balance. Those are the best.</p>

        <p>Us is like Jordan Peele’s perfect second follow up album to his #1 charting Get Out. It has a very similar feel but otherwise bears no relation. It’s got quite a bit of worldbuilding, and the fantastical bent of it permits the more overtly weird aspects – like the scissors, or the raspy voices – to blend and contribute rather than stick out as awkward. I really liked the raspy voices in particular: how creepy, that you talk so little that you aren’t even sure how to do it properly anymore.</p>

        This filthy trick makes sure that the content always weakly tries to expand to the full
        width available, but allows for linebreaks if the viewport is too small. It produces a
        better result than, say, width: 100%; or width: some-fixed-pixel-amount; and doesn't require
        rewriting everything to flexbox (which would mess with the <html>-level scroll behavior and
        sticky header) or adding extra DOM (which I'm trying to minimize to make myself feel good).

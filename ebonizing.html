  </header><p>Ebonzing wood is the process of putting a black finish on woods by wetting them with an iron solution, which reacts with tannins in the wood to turn black. I referenced two guides:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://timberbiscuitwoodworks.com/blog/how-to-ebonize-wood">Timber Biscuit Woodworks</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/finishing/ebonizing_wood/">Popular Woodworking</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Both are good, but the former felt easier to follow to me. Here are my notes:</p>

<p>Two cups of distilled white vinegar and half a pad of #0000 steel wool took two weeks to stop reacting and settle on a color remarkably like black tea (after I strained it out). I should have started earlier. It’s possible that more iron would make a solution that performs “better” in some fashion, but I didn’t try.</p>

<p>Yes, spring for the quebracho powder/extract. I bought <a href="https://www.vandykestaxidermy.com/BKT2-P3850.aspx">the one from Van Dyke’s</a> one of the guides linked, which was about $30 all-in. (They have a weird shipping-cost policy… it is not $0 as it appears.) Despite supposedly being one of the more tannic woods, my white oak turned at best a pallid grey without help. I also tried oversteeping cheap black tea to make an undrinkably astringent (i.e. tannic) brew before using the bark extract, but it barely made a difference.</p>

<p>The ebonized layer is thin and the ebonizing solutions themselves are water-thin, so plan your glue-up/sanding/finishing accordingly. I would not recommend more than burnishing or fine steel wool once the ebonizing is done. If you’re doing ebonized accent pieces, you may need to do your sanding/glue-up out of order to avoid accidentally ebonizing adjacent wood, because the solutions <em>will</em> bleed.</p>

<p>Make sure you get into the deep grain, if your chosen wood has it. My first pieces had a lot of completely un-ebonized white grain streaks, which looked bad. I didn’t do any formal side-by-side testing, but some combination of (1) two coats (of each solution, alternating), (2) using steel wool to lightly rub in the iron solution and (3) a drop of dish soap to break the surface tension allowed me to get a consistent black throughout on white oak. Guide #1 above recommends also sanding and then repeating the whole process, but I didn’t try that. (Maybe next time I’ll try those three separately and see which actually helps.)</p>

<p>Use a squirt bottle or pour the solutions into cups/trays. Because this finish is two-part, you don’t want to get one part into the other! All of your applicators will turn the same dark grey/black by the time you’re done, which you don’t want to happen to your entire supply of the solutions.</p>

<p>You may end up with a slightly splotchy dark grey, but once you put the final finish on the workpiece it should all turn a deep, even black. Check out the pictures below.</p>

<p><strong>Test, test, test!</strong> Variances in wood, application technique, brewing up the solution… there’s a lot of variables which you don’t want to learn about the hard way on your almost-finished workpiece.</p>

<p>Here’s a few pictures from the process.</p>

        This filthy trick makes sure that the content always weakly tries to expand to the full
        width available, but allows for linebreaks if the viewport is too small. It produces a
        better result than, say, width: 100%; or width: some-fixed-pixel-amount; and doesn't require
        rewriting everything to flexbox (which would mess with the <html>-level scroll behavior and
        sticky header) or adding extra DOM (which I'm trying to minimize to make myself feel good).
